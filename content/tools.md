I often get questions about my setup and the software I use. Most of the time, it’s something like, “How do I make my desktop look cool like yours?” So, here’s a page detailing everything I use daily.

My motivation behind choosing my operating system and software is to maximize efficiency and work seamlessly. I aim to use my computer “at the speed of thought,” which is why I prefer minimal yet powerful tools. This setup works best for me, but it may not be for everyone.

## Software

- For my operating system, I use **[Arch Linux (btw)](https://archlinux.org/)**. It’s the only Linux distribution that truly gets out of my way and lets me focus on my work. While the initial learning curve can be steep, it’s minimal, customizable, and absolutely worth the investment.

- *[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)* is my window manager—basically, “**how I make my desktop look cool.**” A tiling window manager is essential for my workflow, and Hyprland, being Wayland-based, provides smooth animations along with efficiency. Previously, I’ve used other setups, but Hyprland fits my needs best.

- **[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)** serves as my status bar at the top.

- For my terminal, I use **foot** because of its speed, customization, and support for images in Wayland. My shell is **Zsh**, enhanced with plugins for syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making it even more productive.

- I use **Thorium** as my web browser. It’s Chromium-based, offering great speed and efficiency while avoiding the telemetry and bloat of other browsers. It’s my go-to for everything web-related.

- For browser extensions, I keep things minimal:

    - uBlock Origin to block ads and trackers.
    - Vimium for vim-like keybindings.


## Applications  

I use **Neovim** for all of my coding. Vim notoriously has a steep learning curve, but as with most things, I think the payoff is worth it.  

**VSCodium** is my secondary code editor for when I’m working on larger projects. It’s essentially VS Code but without Microsoft’s telemetry, making it a great open-source alternative.  

For file management in the terminal, I use **Yazi**. It’s fast, highly customizable, and supports image previews, making navigation much smoother.  

For note-taking, I use **Obsidian**. I haven’t been using it for very long, and I’m still exploring its features, but so far, it’s been great for organizing knowledge efficiently.  

For reading books, I use **Foliate**, which provides a clean and distraction-free experience.  

For Telegram, I prefer **64gram**, as it’s lightweight and efficient.  

For office work, I use **WPS Office**, which offers great compatibility with Microsoft Office formats.  

For email, I use **Thunderbird**. While it has its quirks, it’s still the best email client available on Linux.  

For an application launcher, I use **Tofi**. I previously used Rofi, but I had some issues with it on Wayland. Tofi is simpler, highly customizable, and works flawlessly. I also use it as a power menu.  

## Theme

- I use the **Tokyo Night and Catppuccin** color scheme for just about everything.
- For my terminal font, I use **[JetBrains Mono](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono)**. Of course, I also use [Nerd Font](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_FSqS4C1Ns) icons.

## This Website

- This site is built with **[Hugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwkjqMs7ZYI)** and **PaperMod theme**, Hugo a static site generator that just outputs HTML and CSS instead of the bloated mess that is most of the modern web.
