#### working on it I will add some tools that I use in my daily life.

I often get questions about my setup and the software I use. Most of the time, it’s something like, “How do I make my desktop look cool like yours?” So, here’s a page detailing everything I use daily.

My motivation behind choosing my operating system and software is to maximize efficiency and work seamlessly. I aim to use my computer “at the speed of thought,” which is why I prefer minimal yet powerful tools. This setup works best for me, but it may not be for everyone.

## Software

For my operating system, I use Arch Linux (btw). It’s the only Linux distribution that gets out of my way and just lets me do my work. It’s very minimal and easy-to-use after you get over the initial learning curve, but it’s definitely worth the investment.
Hyprland is my window manager, or basically “how I make my desktop look cool”. For my workflow, a tiling window manager is essential once you get over the learning curve. Hyprland uses Wayland and also has some nice animations. Previously, I’ve used bspwm in some older videos.
Waybar is the status bar at the top.
I currently use kitty for my terminal due to its support for images in Wayland. It’s very customizable but still very fast. For my shell, I use zsh with a few plugins for niceties like syntax highlighting and auto-complete.
For my web browser, I use Firefox. I’ve tried every other browser and Firefox, despite its flaws, remains the best. However, I use a custom user.js file (based on Betterfox) to disable trackers and remove annoying features. I also use a custom theme to make it look a bit nicer. Brave is also very good and I still use it occasionally for websites that don’t work in Firefox.
For browser extensions, I use uBlock Origin to block ads and trackers, Vimium for vim-like keybindings, and Bitwarden for password management. Everything else is superfluous.
