#### working on it I will add some tools that I use in my daily life.

I often get questions about my setup and the software I use. Most of the time, it’s something like, “How do I make my desktop look cool like yours?” So, here’s a page detailing everything I use daily.

My motivation behind choosing my operating system and software is to maximize efficiency and work seamlessly. I aim to use my computer “at the speed of thought,” which is why I prefer minimal yet powerful tools. This setup works best for me, but it may not be for everyone.

## Software

- For my operating system, I use Arch Linux (btw). It’s the only Linux distribution that truly gets out of my way and lets me focus on my work. While the initial learning curve can be steep, it’s minimal, customizable, and absolutely worth the investment.

- Hyprland is my window manager—basically, “how I make my desktop look cool.” A tiling window manager is essential for my workflow, and Hyprland, being Wayland-based, provides smooth animations along with efficiency. Previously, I’ve used other setups, but Hyprland fits my needs best.

- Waybar serves as my status bar at the top.

- For my terminal, I use Kitty because of its speed, customization, and support for images in Wayland. My shell is Zsh, enhanced with plugins for syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making it even more productive.

- I use Thorium as my web browser. It’s Chromium-based, offering great speed and efficiency while avoiding the telemetry and bloat of other browsers. It’s my go-to for everything web-related.

- For browser extensions, I keep things minimal:

    - uBlock Origin to block ads and trackers.
    - Vimium for vim-like keybindings.
