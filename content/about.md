# About

Hey, I'm Ahmad Hassan -- a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer from Pakistan. I currently work at [VieroMind](https://vieromind.com) and study at MNS University of Agriculture, Multan. I build web applications, contribute to open source, and write about things I learn along the way.

## What I Do

I work primarily with **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **Golang** on the frontend and backend, with cloud infrastructure on **AWS**. My day-to-day involves building full-stack applications, designing system architecture, and shipping products from idea to deployment.

Some things I've built:

- [**SehatScan**](https://github.com/ahmad9059/SehatScan) -- An AI-powered health assessment platform that analyzes medical documents and facial images to generate personalized health insights, built with Next.js, Python, AWS, and Google Gemini.
- [**HyprFlux**](https://github.com/ahmad9059/HyprFlux) -- A collection of dotfiles and configs for a minimal Hyprland desktop on Arch Linux. It has over **800+ stars** on GitHub.
- [**MindOasis**](https://github.com/ahmad9059/MindOasis) -- A hackathon project that helps users in Pakistan find mental health professionals, powered by AI-generated profile summaries.
- [**HisaabScore**](https://github.com/ahmad9059/HisaabScore) -- An AI-powered alternative credit scoring system for gig workers and people in the informal economy.
- [**CodingHawks**](https://github.com/ahmad9059/codinghawks) -- The official website for the Coding Hawks Society at my university.

You can see more on my [projects page](/projects/).

## Open Source & Community

Open source is something I genuinely care about. I've made **2,000+ contributions on GitHub** in 2025 alone, and I try to build tools that are useful to others. HyprFlux started as my personal dotfiles and turned into something the Linux community actually uses daily -- that kind of thing keeps me going.

I also like competitive programming. I've solved **400+ problems** on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, ranked **#92 worldwide and #2 in Pakistan** at UC Berkeley's CALICO Spring '25 competition, and picked up a few wins at national-level hackathons and programming contests.

## Writing

I write technical blogs here covering system design, AWS cloud, web development, databases, shell scripting, and occasionally personal topics. I started writing because it helps me think more clearly about what I'm learning, and if it helps someone else along the way, even better. Check out my [blog posts](/posts/).

## Beyond Code

I'm an Arch Linux user running a Hyprland setup -- I like my tools fast, minimal, and keyboard-driven. Neovim is my primary editor, Zsh is my shell, and I try to keep things distraction-free. You can see my full setup on the [tools page](/tools/).

When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading about productivity and self-improvement, customizing my Linux desktop, or exploring new tech.
