# About

I'm simply a normal person that loves to share her ideas with others by means of writing. One of my favorite things to do as a software engineer is write about anything from programming to technology to everything else as I find such subjects fascinating. Additionally being supportive of open-source software, I try to help the community whenever I have the chance. I wish you like reading my blog and find it to be useful. Please contact me should you have any questions or comments without hesitating. If only you could get in touch with me.

Thank you for visiting my blog! <3
