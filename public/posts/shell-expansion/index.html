When you type a command and press Enter, the shell performs several steps before execution. After tokenization, Command Identification (splitting the command into words/tokens) and parsing, the shell performs expansions. Expansion = the process of replacing symbols, variables, or patterns with their actual values. Example:\necho $HOME Here $HOME is expanded into your actual home directory path (like /home/ahmad).\nOrder of Shell Expansions Bash applies expansions in a specific order:\nBrace Expansion { } Tilde Expansion ~ Parameter and Variable Expansion $VAR Command Substitution `cmd` or $(cmd) Arithmetic Expansion $(( expression )) Process Substitution \u003c(cmd) or \u003e(cmd) Word Splitting Filename Expansion (Globbing) * ? [] Quote Removal After expansions, quote removal is performed. Meaning: surrounding quotes (\", ') are stripped, but they influence whether expansions like word splitting or globbing happen. Brace Expansion in Shell (String List) Brace Expansion Brace expansion is a feature in Bash that allows you to generate arbitrary strings. It is not variable expansion or filename expansion, but rather a way to produce multiple strings at once. Example: echo {old,new,current,backup} Output:\nold new current backup Types of Brace Expansion There are two types:\nString lists → comma-separated items inside {} Range/sequence lists → numeric or character ranges (covered later) General Syntax (String List Form) [prefix]{item1,item2,item3,...}[suffix] Prefix → optional string before braces. Suffix → optional string after braces. Items → comma-separated list inside braces. Example:\necho 01-{old,new,current,backup}.txt Output:\n01-old.txt 01-new.txt 01-current.txt 01-backup.txt Using Brace Expansion with Commands Brace expansions are not limited to echo. They can be used with any command:\nCreate files:\ntouch {old,new,current,backup}.txt Remove files:\nrm {old,new,current,backup}.txt Rules and Restrictions No spaces allowed around commas: echo {a, b} # Wrong → prints {a, b} echo {a,b} # Correct → prints a b Must have unquoted { } and at least one unquoted comma. Incorrectly formed expansions are left unchanged: echo \"{a,b}\" # Prints {a,b}, no expansion Nested Brace Expansions Brace expansions can be nested inside each other:\necho {old,new}-{10,20,30} Output:\nold-10 old-20 old-30 new-10 new-20 new-30 Expansion is performed from left to right. Brace Expansion in Shell (Ranges / Sequences) What is Sequence Brace Expansion? It generates a contiguous range of numbers or letters. General form: {start..end[..step]} Works for integers and characters (letters). Basic Examples\nNumbers: echo {1..5} Output:\n1 2 3 4 5 Letters:\necho {A..L} Output:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L echo {A..Z} Output:\nA B C ... X Y Z Increment (Step Value) You can specify a step size. echo {1..20..2} Output:\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 By default, step = 1. Zero Padding If a number starts with 0, Bash pads all numbers to the same width. echo {01..10} Output:\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 Also\necho {005..010} Output:\n005 006 007 008 009 010 Reverse Sequences You can reverse the order.\necho {10..1} Output:\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Also\necho {Z..A} Output:\nZ Y X W V ... C B A Restrictions Both values must be the same type:\n✅ Numbers with numbers ✅ Letters with letters ❌ Cannot mix letters and numbers: echo {1..A} # Invalid, stays unchanged Expansion Order (Important) Brace expansion happens before variable expansion. This means you cannot use variables inside brace ranges. A=1 echo {$A..50} # ❌ Does NOT work The shell tries to expand braces before replacing $A.\nTilde Expansion in Shell After brace expansion, the shell performs tilde expansion. The ~ symbol is expanded to represent home directories and certain working directories. Common Expansions Current user’s home directory echo ~ cd ~ Expands to $HOME (example: /home/ahmad).\nSpecific user’s home directory echo ~root Expands to /root.\nCurrent working directory echo ~+ Expands to $PWD.\nPrevious working directory echo ~- Expands to $OLDPWD.\nIf $OLDPWD is not set, ~- does not expand. Directory stack entries (advanced, when using pushd / popd) ~N → Nth directory from the directory stack. ~-N → Nth entry counting from the right. Parameter and Variable Expansion Use $ before a variable name: os=linux echo $os echo ${os} Both output:\nlinux Why braces {}?\nTo protect the variable name when followed by characters. echo $osmint # tries to expand $osmint (doesn’t exist) echo ${os}mint # expands $os + \"mint\" → linuxmint Case Modification Operators Uppercase all letters: echo ${os^^} → LINUX\nLowercase all letters: echo ${os,,} → linux\nNote: (Single ^ or , affects only the first character.)\nDefault Value Substitution a) Use default if variable is unset/null:\nping -c 3 ${ip:-1.1.1.1} If $ip exists → use its value. If $ip doesn’t exist → use 1.1.1.1. b) Assign default if variable is unset/null:\nping -c 3 ${ip:=8.8.4.4} If $ip is not set → assign 8.8.4.4 to it. Now $ip has this value permanently in the script. Perfect, that transcript is walking you through Command Substitution in shell scripting.\nHere are the detailed notes you can keep:\nCommand Substitution in Shell Command substitution allows you to run a command and use its output as a value inside your script. Think of it as replacing the command with its result. Extremely useful for dynamic values like dates, usernames, process lists, etc. Syntax There are two ways (both valid):\na) Backticks `command` (older form) now=`date` echo \"$now\" b) Dollar-parentheses $(command) (modern, preferred) now=$(date) echo \"$now\" ✅ Both execute date and store its output in now.\n✅ The second form is clearer, supports nesting, and is more common in modern scripts.\nBest Practices with Quotes Always wrap the substitution in double quotes. now=\"$(date)\" Why? To prevent word splitting and filename expansion on the output. Without quotes, spaces in the output can break your script. Examples Store date in variable now=$(date) echo \"The time is: $now\" Count logged-in users users=$(who) echo \"Users logged in: $users\" Using pipelines in substitution bash_processes=$(ps -ef | grep bash) echo \"$bash_processes\" Archive with timestamp in filename tar -czf etc-$(date +%F-%H%M).tar.gz /etc %F → YYYY-MM-DD %H → Hour (00-23) %M → Minute Result: etc-2025-09-11-1021.tar.gz\nOverwriting vs unique files Without substitution → archive overwrites on rerun. With substitution → new file each run (different name due to timestamp). Why prefer $(command) over backticks? Easier to read. Can nest commands: echo \"Today is $(date +%A), user count: $(who | wc -l)\" Backticks `...` require escaping and become messy in nested cases. Summary Command substitution = replace command with its output. Syntax: `command` or $(command) (preferred). Always quote results \"$(command)\". Useful for logging, filenames, conditional logic, and dynamic input. Arithmetic Expansion in Shell Scripting $(( expression )) Everything inside (( )) is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. The result replaces the expression in the command line. Example:\nx=$((7 * 9)) echo $x # 63 Key Points Tokens inside the expression undergo: Parameter expansion (variables are expanded) Command substitution (commands inside will execute first) Quote removal Operators \u0026 precedence\nSame as in C or other languages: + - * / % (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus) ** (power/exponentiation) Comparison (\u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=, ==, !=) Logical (\u0026\u0026, ||, !) Assignment (=, +=, -=, etc.) Examples echo $((2 + 3 * 4)) # 14 echo $((2 ** 8)) # 256 Using let The let built-in command also evaluates arithmetic:\nlet y=2**8 echo $y # 256 Limitations Only integers are supported No floating-point numbers in Bash arithmetic. Example: echo $((5 / 2)) # 2, not 2.5 Overflow possible If a number exceeds the system’s max integer size, it wraps around or becomes zero. Example: echo $((2 ** 128)) # Overflow → result invalid Decimal (Floating-Point) Calculations with bc For real numbers, use bc (Basic Calculator).\nPipe to bc echo \"3 * 7\" | bc # 21 Division with scale echo \"scale=2; 11 / 4\" | bc # 2.75 scale=n → number of decimal places to show. Using Here String bc \u003c\u003c\u003c \"scale=3; 23 / 7\" # 3.285 Interactive mode bc # Then type expressions manually Summary\nUse $(( )) for integer math in scripts. Use let as an alternative. For floating-point or high-precision math, use bc. Process Substitution in Shell Process substitution allows you to treat the output of a command as if it were a file. In Linux, “everything is a file”, so the shell can represent command output internally as a temporary file (often in /dev/fd/). Example:\ncat \u003c(ls) \u003c(ls) runs ls, creates a file descriptor with the output, and cat reads it like a file. Syntax Input form: \u003c(command) Note: The output of command becomes a file-like input.\nOutput form: \u003e(command) The output of your program is sent as input to command. Note: No space between \u003c or \u003e and the parentheses.\n\u003c(ls) # ✅ valid \u003c (ls) # ❌ error Basic Example echo \u003c(ls) Prints something like: /dev/fd/63 (a file descriptor). cat \u003c(ls) Prints the actual content of ls (directory listing). Practical Example: Comparing Directories You want to compare filenames in two directories:\nmkdir dir1 dir2 touch dir1/a dir1/b dir2/a dir2/c # Compare contents of dir1 and dir2 diff \u003c(ls dir1) \u003c(ls dir2) Output:\n1d0 \u003c b 1a2 \u003e c Shows that b is only in dir1 and c is only in dir2. 5. Why Use Process Substitution? Lets you use commands that normally expect files as input, but instead give them command output. Avoids creating temporary files with \u003e redirection. Useful in loops, arrays, and comparisons. Real-World Use Cases Compare process lists: diff \u003c(ps -ef | sort) \u003c(ps -ef | sort -r) Feed multiple commands into paste: paste \u003c(ls dir1) \u003c(ls dir2) Sorting and comparing logs: diff \u003c(sort file1.log) \u003c(sort file2.log) Notes Available in Bash, Zsh, Ksh, but not in POSIX sh. Internally uses named pipes (FIFOs) or /dev/fd. Very powerful with tools like diff, comm, paste. Summary\nProcess substitution = treat command output like a file. Syntax: \u003c(command) or \u003e(command) (no space). Useful for comparisons, loops, avoiding temp files. Works with commands that require filenames instead of STDIN. Word Splitting, explained Word splitting is the shell step that breaks the result of unquoted expansions into separate words, using the IFS variable as delimiters. It happens after brace expansion, tilde, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and process substitution, but before filename expansion (globbing) and quote removal.\nIFS (Internal Field Separator) Default value, contains space, tab, newline (these are invisible characters). IFS defines the delimiters used for splitting. You can view IFS in a readable way, for example: # show escapes for whitespace characters printf '%s\\n' \"${IFS@Q}\" # or echo \"$IFS\" | sed -n 'l' Basic behavior, examples Unquoted expansion is split, quoted expansion is not dirs=\"d1 d2 d3\" mkdir $dirs # unquoted, word splitting creates 3 dirs: d1, d2, d3 mkdir \"$dirs\" # quoted, creates a single dir named \"d1 d2 d3\" Change IFS to split on other characters oldIFS=$IFS IFS=':' dirs=\"d1:d2:d3\" mkdir $dirs # creates d1, d2, d3 because IFS is ':' IFS=$oldIFS # restore original IFS Tip, temporary change in a subshell:\n( IFS=':'; mkdir $dirs ) # IFS change scoped to subshell Special behavior, important gotchas When IFS contains whitespace (default), consecutive whitespace is treated as a single delimiter, and leading/trailing whitespace is ignored. Example: s=\" a b c \" set -- $s # with default IFS printf '[%s]\\n' \"$@\" # prints [a] [b] [c] When IFS contains non-whitespace characters (for example :), adjacent delimiters create empty fields. Example: IFS=':' s=\"a::b\" set -- $s printf '[%s]\\n' \"$@\" # prints [a] [] [b], note the empty element Word splitting is applied to the results of unquoted expansions only. If you want to avoid splitting, quote the expansion: \"$var\". Unquoted expansions are also subject to filename expansion (globbing) after splitting. Example risk: names=\"*.txt\" rm $names # could expand and delete files rm \"$names\" # removes a file literally named \"*.txt\", or fails if none Common, safe patterns 1) Forward script arguments safely # preserve argument boundaries, even with spaces some_command \"$@\" 2) Split into an array safely IFS=':' read -ra parts \u003c\u003c\u003c \"$PATH\" # now ${parts[0]}, ${parts[1]}, ... are PATH elements Use -r to prevent backslash escape interpretation, -a to populate an array.\n3) Temporarily change IFS without side effects oldIFS=$IFS IFS=',' # do work that requires comma splitting IFS=$oldIFS or use a subshell, ( IFS=','; ... ).\nSummary, short rules Word splitting happens only on unquoted expansion results. Default IFS = space, tab, newline. Change it if you need other delimiters. Prefer \"$var\" to avoid accidental splitting and globbing, unless you intentionally want splitting. Use \"$@\" to forward arguments safely. Use read -ra or array read patterns to split into arrays safely. Be mindful of whitespace vs non-whitespace IFS differences, they behave differently with adjacent delimiters. Filename Expansion (Globbing) in Shell What is Globbing? Globbing is the process where the shell expands special characters into matching filenames or paths. It happens after word splitting in the expansion order. Works in any command (ls, rm, cp, etc). If the pattern does not match any file, behavior depends on the shell: In bash (default): the pattern is kept literally. With shopt -s nullglob, unmatched patterns expand to nothing. Special Globbing Characters Asterisk (*) Matches zero or more characters. Example: ls f* → matches f, fa.txt, foo.txt, etc.\nNote: Hidden files (starting with .) are not matched unless explicitly included: ls .* Question Mark (?) Matches exactly one character. Example: ls fa?.txt → matches fa1.txt, fab.txt, but not fa10.txt. → it work as placeholder so you can add multiple ? to match pattern like\nls fa??.txt # Output fa10.txt # any two place file It has two placeholder here that match anything in ? part\nSquare Brackets ([]) Matches one character from a set or range. Examples: ls fa[123].txt # matches fa1.txt, fa2.txt, fa3.txt ls fa[a-c].txt # matches faa.txt, fab.txt, fac.txt You can use ranges: [a-z] → lowercase letters [A-Z] → uppercase letters [0-9] → digits Negation inside [] [^...] or [!... ] matches any single character not in the set.\nExample:\nls fa[^0-9].txt → matches faa.txt but not fa3.txt.\nImportant Notes Quoting prevents globbing: ls \"fa*.txt\" → searches for a file literally named fa*.txt (no expansion).\nAlways test dangerous commands (like rm) with echo first: echo fa*.txt rm fa*.txt Summary:\n* → zero or more chars ? → exactly one char [abc] → match a, b, or c [a-z] → range match [^...] or [!... ] → negation
