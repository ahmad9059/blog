It is used to store and manage data in a structured format.","keywords":["tech","mysql","database"],"articleBody":"Database Database is a collection of interrelated data.\nA database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores data in tables, rows, and columns, allowing efficient retrieval and manipulation. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. DBMS DBMS(Database Management System) is software used to create, manage, and organize databases.\nA DBMS is software that manages and controls database operations like storing, retrieving, and updating data. It ensures data consistency, security, and integrity while providing an interface for users to interact with the database. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 🚀 What is RDBMS RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - is a DBMS based on the concept of tables (also called relations). Data is organized into tables(also known as relations) with rows(records) and columns(attributes). E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server etc. SQL SQL is Structured Query Language - used to store, manipulate and retrieve data from RDBMS.\nWe use SQL for CRUD Operations:\nCREATE - To Create databases, tables, insert tuples etc. READ - To read data present int the database. UPDATE - Modify already insert data. DELETE - Delete database, table or specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows. NOTE : SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive. E.g., select is the same as SELECT in SQL.\nCreate Database We can use the the following command to create the database.\nCREATE DATABASE database_name; Delete Database We Can use the DROP command to delete the database.\nDROP DATABASE database_name; Select/Use the Database We can use the USE command to select db and perform operation.\nUSE db_name; SQL vs MySQL SQL is a language used to perform CRUD operations in Relational DB, while MySQL is a RDBMS that uses SQL.\nCreating Table We can create the table in db using the CREATE TABLE command whole syntax is given below.\nCREATE TABLE table_name( column_name1 datatype constraint; column_name2 datatype constraint; column_name3 datatype constraint; ); SQL Data Types In SQL, data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column or variable.\nDatatype Description Usage CHAR String (0-255), can store characters of fixed length CHAR(50) VARCHAR String (0-255), can store characters up to given length VARCHAR(50) BLOB String (0-65535), can store binary large object BLOB(1000) INT Integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) INT TINYINT Integer (-128 to 127) TINYINT BIGINT Integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) BIGINT BIT Can store x-bit values. x can range from 1 to 64 BIT(2) FLOAT Decimal number - with precision to 23 digits FLOAT DOUBLE Decimal number - with 24 to 53 digits DOUBLE BOOLEAN Boolean values 0 or 1 BOOLEAN DATE Date in format of YYYY-MM-DD ranging from 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31 DATE TIME HH:MM:SS TIME YEAR Year in 4-digit format ranging from 1901 to 2155 YEAR Note - CHAR is for fixed length \u0026 VARCHAR is for variable length strings. Generally, VARCHAR is better as it only occupies necessary memory \u0026 works more efficiently.\nSigned \u0026 Unsigned : We can also use UNSIGNED with datatypes when we only have positive values to add. Eg - UNSIGNED INT\nTINYINT UNSIGNED (0 to 255)\nTINYINT (-128 to 127)\nTypes of SQL Commands DDL(Database Definition Language): Used to create, alter, delete database objects like tables, indexes, etc. (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE). DQL(Database Query Language): Used to retrieve data from databases. (SELECT). DML(Database Manipulation Language): Used to modify the database. (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). DCL(Database Control Language): Used to grant \u0026 revoke permissions. (GRANT, REVOKE). TCL(Transaction Control Language): Used to manage transactions, (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, START TRANSACTIONS, SAVEPOINT). DATABASE related Queries CREATE DATABASE db_name; -- used to create database CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name; -- create database if database not exist of this name. DROP DATABASE db_name; -- delete database DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name; -- delete database if exists SHOW DATABASES; -- show all databases SHOW TABLES; -- used to show all tables in particular database Table related Queries Create Tables We can use the following syntax to create the table or design the scheme of table.\nCREATE TABLE table_name( column_name1 datatype constraint; column_name2 datatype constraint; ); Example\nCREATE TABLE student( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), age INT NOT NULL ); Select \u0026 View ALL columns SELECT * FROM table_name; -- display whole table Insert INSERT INTO table_name (colname1, colname2); VALUES (col1_v1, col2_v1), (col1_v2, col2_v2); Keys Primary Key It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id). There is only 1 Primary Key and it should not be NOT null\nForeign Key A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. There can be multiple FKs. FKs can be have duplicate \u0026 null values.\nSecondary Key Secondary key may or may not be unique field. Some times records are required to access by a field other than the primary key. In these situations another key that is used is called secondary key.\nComposite Key Composite key consists of two or more than two fields. Composite key is also designed as a primary key. It is created in a situation when no single field fulfills the property of uniqueness. To make unique more than one field are combined and used as primary key.\nConstraints SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.\nNOT NULL : columns cannot have null value. col1 INT NOT NULL UNIQUE : all values in column are different. col2 UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY : makes a column unique \u0026 not null but used only for one. id INT PRIMARY KEY. also declare as PRIMARY KEY (id). Foreign Key Prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.\nCREATE TABLE temp( cust_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) references customer(id) ); DEFAULT sets the default value of a column\nsalary INT DEFAULT default_value; CHECK It can limit the values allowed in a column.\nCREATE TABLE city( id INT PRIMARY KEY, city VARCHAR(50), age INT, CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age\u003e= 16 AND city=\"Delhi\") ); CREATE TABLE newTab ( age INT CHECK (age\u003e=18) ); Select in Detail SELECT The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.\nSELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name; To Select All SELECT * FROM table_name; Tip: DISTINCT Keyword Removes duplicate rows from query results.\nSyntax:\nSELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table_name; Where Clause To define some conditions\nSELECT col1,col2 from table WHERE condition(s). SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks \u003e 80; SELECT * FROM student WHERE city=\"Multan\"; Operator in WHERE Arithmetic Operators : + , - , * , / , % Comparison Operators : = , != , \u003e , \u003e= , \u003c , \u003c= Logical Operators : AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY Bitwise Operators : \u0026 , | Operators AND (to check for both conditions to be true) SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks \u003e 80 AND city=\"Multan\"; OR (to check for one of the conditions to be true) SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks \u003e 90 OR city=\"Lahore\"; BETWEEN : select for a given range SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90; IN : (matches any value in the list) SELECT * FROM student WHERE city IN (\"Multan\",\"Karachi\") NOT : (to negate the given condition) SELECT * FROM student WHERE city NOT IN (\"Multan\", \"Karachi\") Limit Clause The limit clause is used to sets an upper limit on number of(tuples)rows to be returned.\nSELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3; SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name LIMIT number; Order by Clause To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.\nSELECT * FROM student ORDER BY city ASC; SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name(s) ASC; Aggregate Functions Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.\nCOUNT() MAX() MIN() SUM() AVG() Get Maximum Marks\nSELECT MAX(marks) FROM student; Get Average marks\nSELECT AVG(marks) FROM student; Group By Clause Group rows that have the same values into summary rows. It collect data from multiple records(rows) and groups the result by one ore more column.\nGenerally we use the group by with some aggregation function.\nCount number of students in each city\nSELECT city, count(name) FROM student GROUP BY city; HAVING Clause Similar to WHERE i.e., applies some condition on rows. Used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.\nCount number of students in each city where max marks cross 90.\nSELECT city, count(rollno) FROM student GROUP BY city HAVING MAX(marks) \u003e 90; General Order SELECT column(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column(s) ASC;\nExample:\nSELECT city FROM student WHERE grade = \"A\" GROUP BY city HAVING MAX(marks) \u003e 90 ORDER BY city DESC; Table related Queries UPDATE is used to update existing rows in a table.\nUPDATE table_name SET col1=val1, col2=val2 WHERE condition; UPDATE student SET grade = \"O\" WHERE grade = \"A\"; DELETE is used to delete the existing rows in a table\nDELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; DELETE FROM student WHERE marks \u003c 33; Foreign Key A foreign key (FK) is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It refers to the primary key (PK) in another table, ensuring data integrity and enforcing referential constraints.\nCREATE TABLE Orders ( order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) ); Cascading for FK On Delete Cascade When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key.\nOn Update Cascade When we create a foreign key using UPDATE CASCADE the referencing rows are updated in the child table when the referenced row is updated in the parent table which has a primary key.\nCREATE TABLE teacher( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), dept_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) references dept(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE ); Alter The ALTER is used to change the schema of table in a database.\nADD Column ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraint; DROP Column ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name; RENAME Column ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name; CHANGE Column(rename) ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name new_datatype new_constraint; MODIFY Column(modify datatype/ constraint) ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY col_name new_datatype new_constraint; Truncate The TRUNCATE is used to delete the data of table in database.\nTRUNCATE TABLE table_name ; Joins in SQL JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.\n1. Inner Join Returns records that have matching values in both tables Syntax\nSELECT column(s) FROM tableA INNER JOIN tableB ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name; Example\nSELECT * FROM student INNER JOIN course ON student.student_id = course.student_id; Tip: SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. An alias is created with the AS keyword.\nSELECT CustomerID AS ID FROM Customers; 2. Left Join Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. Syntax\nSELECT columns(s) FROM talbeA LEFT JOIN tableB ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name; Example\nSELECT * FROM student as s LEFT JOIN course as c ON s.student_id = c.student_id; 3. Right Join Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table\nSyntax\nSELECT column(s) FROM tableA RIGHT JOIN tableB ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name; Example\nSELECT * FROM student as s RIGHT JOIN course as c ON s.student_id = c.student_id; 4. Full Join Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table\nSELECT * FROM student AS s LEFT JOIN course AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id UNION SELECT * FROM student AS s LEFT JOIN course AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id; Left Exclusive Join Exclusive joins in SQL are used to retrieve records that exist in one table but not in the other when performing a LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN.\nA Left Exclusive Join retrieves records from the left table that do not have matching records in the right table.\nSELECT * FROM student AS a LEFT JOIN course AS b ON a.id = b.id WHERE b.id IS NULL; Right Exclusive Join A Right Exclusive Join retrieves records from the right table that do not have matching records in the left table.\nSELECT * FROM student AS a RIGHT JOIN course AS b ON a.id = b.id WHERE a.id IS NULL; Self Join It is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.\nSELECT column(s) FROM table as a JOIN table as b ON a.col_name = b.col_name Union It is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. Gives UNIQUE records.\nevery SELECT should have same no. of columns columns must have similar data types columns in every SELECT should be in same order SELECT column(s) FROM tableA UNION SELECT column(s) FROM tableB and we can also use the UNION ALL to give all the values including the duplicates records.\nSQL Sub Queries A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query. It is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition.\nIt involves 2 select statements.\nSyntax SELECT column(s) FROM table_name WHERE col_name operator ( subquery ); Example with FROM SELECT MAX(marks) FROM (SELECT marks FROM student WHERE city = 'Delhi') AS temp; MySQL Views A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.\nA view always shows up-to-date data. The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.\nCREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT rollno, name, marks FROM student; Stored Procedures in MySQL A Stored Procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed repeatedly. It helps encapsulate logic in a modular way, improving reusability, maintainability, and performance.\nBenefits of Stored Procedures Modularity – Write once, use many times. Performance – Precompiled for faster execution. Security – Users can be granted access to run procedures without giving access to underlying tables. Reduced network traffic – Fewer queries sent between application and server. Syntax: Creating a Stored Procedure DELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name ( IN param1 datatype, OUT param2 datatype, INOUT param3 datatype ) BEGIN -- SQL statements go here END // DELIMITER ; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID(IN emp_id INT) BEGIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id; END // DELIMITER ; Calling a Stored Procedure CALL GetEmployeeByID(1); If there are OUT or INOUT parameters:\nCALL ProcedureName(@out_param); SELECT @out_param; Types of Parameters Type Description IN Input only (passed by value). OUT Output only (value returned). INOUT Both input and output (passed by reference). Modifying or Dropping Stored Procedures DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS procedure_name; Alter is not supported: You must drop and recreate the procedure. Control Structures in Stored Procedures IF-ELSE Used to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.\nIF condition THEN -- statements ELSE -- statements END IF; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE CheckAge(IN age INT) BEGIN IF age \u003e= 18 THEN SELECT 'You are an adult' AS result; ELSE SELECT 'You are a minor' AS result; END IF; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL CheckAge(20); -- Output: You are an adult CALL CheckAge(15); -- Output: You are a minor CASE Statement Used as an alternative to multiple IF statements when checking several conditions.\nSyntax:\nCASE variable WHEN value1 THEN statement1; WHEN value2 THEN statement2; ELSE statement_default; END CASE; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE GradeResult(IN grade CHAR(1)) BEGIN CASE grade WHEN 'A' THEN SELECT 'Excellent' AS Result; WHEN 'B' THEN SELECT 'Good' AS Result; WHEN 'C' THEN SELECT 'Average' AS Result; ELSE SELECT 'Fail or Invalid Grade' AS Result; END CASE; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL GradeResult('A'); -- Output: Excellent CALL GradeResult('D'); -- Output: Fail or Invalid Grade WHILE Loop Repeats a block of statements while the condition is true.\nSyntax\nWHILE condition DO -- statements END WHILE; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE CountToFive() BEGIN DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1; WHILE i \u003c= 5 DO SELECT CONCAT('Count: ', i) AS Output; SET i = i + 1; END WHILE; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL CountToFive(); ## REPEAT Loop Similar to WHILE, but checks the condition after executing the block.\nSyntax:\nREPEAT -- statements UNTIL condition END REPEAT; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE RepeatExample() BEGIN DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1; REPEAT SELECT CONCAT('Repeat Count: ', i) AS Output; SET i = i + 1; UNTIL i \u003e 5 END REPEAT; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL RepeatExample(); Error Handling Use DECLARE ... HANDLER to define how to handle errors.\nSyntax\nDECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION BEGIN -- Error handling code END; Create the procedure with error handler\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE InsertStudent ( IN student_id INT, IN student_name VARCHAR(50) ) BEGIN DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION BEGIN SELECT 'Error occurred while inserting student!' AS ErrorMessage; END; -- Attempt to insert student INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (student_id, student_name); -- Continue execution even if error occurred SELECT 'Insert attempt completed.' AS Status; END // DELIMITER ; Show Existing Stored Procedures SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db = 'your_database'; Or to view the code:\nSHOW CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name; ","wordCount":"2893","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/assets/opengraph.webp","datePublished":"2025-03-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ahmad Hassan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/mysql/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ahmad","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/assets/fav.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="ahmad (Alt + H)">ahmad</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Introduction to Databases - MySQL</h1><div class=post-description>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
