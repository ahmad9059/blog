Learn how to use these concepts to write better JavaScript code.","keywords":["tech","JavaScript","web"],"articleBody":"Arrays Objects allow you to store keyed collections of values. That’s fine.\nBut quite often we find that we need an ordered collection, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on. For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, goods, HTML elements etc.\nIt is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can’t insert a new property “between” the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.\nThere exists a special data structure named Array, to store ordered collections.\nDeclaration There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:\nlet arr = new Array(); let arr = []; Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"]; Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.\nWe can get an element by its number in square brackets:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"]; alert( fruits[0] ); // Apple alert( fruits[1] ); // Orange alert( fruits[2] ); // Plum We can replace an element:\nfruits[2] = 'Pear'; // now [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"] …Or add a new one to the array:\nfruits[3] = 'Lemon'; // now [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\", \"Lemon\"] The total count of the elements in the array is its length:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"]; alert( fruits.length ); // 3 We can also use alert to show the whole array.\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"]; alert( fruits ); // Apple,Orange,Plum An array can store elements of any type.\nFor instance:\n// mix of values let arr = [ 'Apple', { name: 'John' }, true, function() { alert('hello'); } ]; // get the object at index 1 and then show its name alert( arr[1].name ); // John // get the function at index 3 and run it arr[3](); // hello Get last elements with “at” Let’s say we want the last element of the array.\nSome programming languages allow the use of negative indexes for the same purpose, like fruits[-1].\nAlthough, in JavaScript it won’t work. The result will be undefined, because the index in square brackets is treated literally.\nWe can explicitly calculate the last element index and then access it: fruits[fruits.length - 1].\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"]; alert( fruits[fruits.length-1] ); // Plum A bit cumbersome, isn’t it? We need to write the variable name twice.\nLuckily, there’s a shorter syntax: fruits.at(-1):\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Plum\"]; // same as fruits[fruits.length-1] alert( fruits.at(-1) ); // Plum In other words, arr.at(i):\nis exactly the same as arr[i], if i \u003e= 0. for negative values of i, it steps back from the end of the array. Methods pop/push, shift/unshift A queue is one of the most common uses of an array. In computer science, this means an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:\npush appends an element to the end. shift get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st. Arrays support both operations.\nIn practice we need it very often. For example, a queue of messages that need to be shown on-screen.\nThere’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named stack.\nIt supports two operations:\npush adds an element to the end. pop takes an element from the end. So new elements are added or taken always from the “end”.\nA stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards are added to the top or taken from the top:\nFor stacks, the latest pushed item is received first, that’s also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. For queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).\nArrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements, both to/from the beginning or the end.\nIn computer science, the data structure that allows this, is called deque.\nMethods that work with the end of the array:\npop\nExtracts the last element of the array and returns it:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"]; alert( fruits.pop() ); // remove \"Pear\" and alert it alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange Both fruits.pop() and fruits.at(-1) return the last element of the array, but fruits.pop() also modifies the array by removing it.\npush\nAppend the element to the end of the array:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\"]; fruits.push(\"Pear\"); alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear The call fruits.push(...) is equal to fruits[fruits.length] = ....\nMethods that work with the beginning of the array:\nshift\nExtracts the first element of the array and returns it:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pear\"]; alert( fruits.shift() ); // remove Apple and alert it alert( fruits ); // Orange, Pear unshift\nAdd the element to the beginning of the array:\nlet fruits = [\"Orange\", \"Pear\"]; fruits.unshift('Apple'); alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear Methods push and unshift can add multiple elements at once:\nlet fruits = [\"Apple\"]; fruits.push(\"Orange\", \"Peach\"); fruits.unshift(\"Pineapple\", \"Lemon\"); // [\"Pineapple\", \"Lemon\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"] alert( fruits ); Objects As we know from the chapter Data types, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).\nIn contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.\nAn object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.\nWe can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.\nAn empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:\nlet user = new Object(); // \"object constructor\" syntax let user = {}; // \"object literal\" syntax Usually, the figure brackets {...} are used. That declaration is called an object literal.\nLiterals and properties We can immediately put some properties into {...} as “key: value” pairs:\nlet user = { // an object name: \"John\", // by key \"name\" store value \"John\" age: 30 // by key \"age\" store value 30 }; A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon \":\" and a value to the right of it.\nIn the user object, there are two properties:\nThe first property has the name \"name\" and the value \"John\". The second one has the name \"age\" and the value 30. The resulting user object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled “name” and “age”.\nWe can add, remove and read files from it at any time.\nProperty values are accessible using the dot notation:\n// get property values of the object: alert( user.name ); // John alert( user.age ); // 30 The value can be of any type. Let’s add a boolean one:\nuser.isAdmin = true To remove a property, we can use the delete operator:\ndelete user.age; We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30, \"likes birds\": true // multiword property name must be quoted }; The last property in the list may end with a comma:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30, } That is called a “trailing” or “hanging” comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike.\nSquare brackets For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work:\n// this would give a syntax error user.likes birds = true JavaScript doesn’t understand that. It thinks that we address user.likes, and then gives a syntax error when comes across unexpected birds.\nThe dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters ($ and _ are allowed).\nThere’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:\nlet user = {}; // set user[\"likes birds\"] = true; // get alert(user[\"likes birds\"]); // true // delete delete user[\"likes birds\"]; Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).\nSquare brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression – as opposed to a literal string – like from a variable as follows:\nlet key = \"likes birds\"; // same as user[\"likes birds\"] = true; user[key] = true; Here, the variable key may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.\nFor instance:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30 }; let key = prompt(\"What do you want to know about the user?\", \"name\"); // access by variable alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter \"name\") The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30 }; let key = \"name\"; alert( user.key ) // undefined Computed properties We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called computed properties.\nFor instance:\nlet fruit = prompt(\"Which fruit to buy?\", \"apple\"); let bag = { [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit }; alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit=\"apple\" The meaning of a computed property is simple: [fruit] means that the property name should be taken from fruit.\nSo, if a visitor enters \"apple\", bag will become {apple: 5}.\nEssentially, that works the same as:\nlet fruit = prompt(\"Which fruit to buy?\", \"apple\"); let bag = {}; // take property name from the fruit variable bag[fruit] = 5; …But looks nicer.\nWe can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:\nlet fruit = 'apple'; let bag = { [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5 }; Square brackets are much more powerful than dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.\nSo most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.\nProperty value shorthand In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names.\nFor instance:\nfunction makeUser(name, age) { return { name: name, age: age, // ...other properties }; } let user = makeUser(\"John\", 30); alert(user.name); // John variable is so common, that there’s a special property value shorthand to make it shorter.\nInstead of name:name we can just write name, like this:\nfunction makeUser(name, age) { return { name, // same as name: name age, // same as age: age // ... }; } We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:\nlet user = { name, // same as name:name age: 30 }; Property names limitations As we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of the language-reserved words like “for”, “let”, “return” etc.\nBut for an object property, there’s no such restriction:\n// these properties are all right let obj = { for: 1, let: 2, return: 3 }; alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return ); // 6 In short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).\nOther types are automatically converted to strings.\nFor instance, a number 0 becomes a string \"0\" when used as a property key:\nlet obj = { 0: \"test\" // same as \"0\": \"test\" }; // both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string \"0\") alert( obj[\"0\"] ); // test alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property) Property existence test, “in” operator A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it’s possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn’t exist!\nReading a non-existing property just returns undefined. So we can easily test whether the property exists:\nlet user = {}; alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means \"no such property\" There’s also a special operator \"in\" for that.\nThe syntax is:\n\"key\" in object For instance:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30 }; alert( \"age\" in user ); // true, user.age exists alert( \"blabla\" in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist Please note that on the left side of in there must be a property name. That’s usually a quoted string.\nIf we omit quotes, that means a variable should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:\nlet user = { age: 30 }; let key = \"age\"; alert( key in user ); // true, property \"age\" exists Why does the in operator exist? Isn’t it enough to compare against undefined?\nWell, most of the time the comparison with undefined works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but \"in\" works correctly.\nIt’s when an object property exists, but stores undefined:\nlet obj = { test: undefined }; alert( obj.test ); // it's undefined, so - no such property? alert( \"test\" in obj ); // true, the property does exist! In the code above, the property obj.test technically exists. So the in operator works right.\nSituations like this happen very rarely, because undefined should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use null for “unknown” or “empty” values. So the in operator is an exotic guest in the code.\nThe “for..in” loop To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: for..in. This is a completely different thing from the for(;;) construct that we studied before.\nThe syntax:\nfor (key in object) { // executes the body for each key among object properties } For instance, let’s output all properties of user:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30, isAdmin: true }; for (let key in user) { // keys alert( key ); // name, age, isAdmin // values for the keys alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true } Note that all “for” constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like let key here.\nAlso, we could use another variable name here instead of key. For instance, \"for (let prop in obj)\" is also widely used.\nObject methods, “this” “this” in methods It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.\nFor instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.\nTo access the object, a method can use the this keyword.\nThe value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.\nFor instance:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30, sayHi() { // \"this\" is the \"current object\" alert(this.name); } }; user.sayHi(); // John Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.\nTechnically, it’s also possible to access the object without this, by referencing it via the outer variable:\nlet user = { name: \"John\", age: 30, sayHi() { alert(user.name); // \"user\" instead of \"this\" } }; “this” is not bound In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.\nThere’s no syntax error in the following example:\nfunction sayHi() { alert( this.name ); } The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.\nFor instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different “this” in the calls:\nlet user = { name: \"John\" }; let admin = { name: \"Admin\" }; function sayHi() { alert( this.name ); } // use the same function in two objects user.f = sayHi; admin.f = sayHi; // these calls have different this // \"this\" inside the function is the object \"before the dot\" user.f(); // John (this == user) admin.f(); // Admin (this == admin) admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter) Arrow functions have no “this” Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.\nFor instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method:\nlet user = { firstName: \"Ilya\", sayHi() { let arrow = () =\u003e alert(this.firstName); arrow(); } }; user.sayHi(); // Ilya That’s a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate this, but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited we’ll go more deeply into arrow functions.\nSummary Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”. Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething(). Methods can reference the object as this. The value of this is defined at run-time.\nWhen a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called. A function can be copied between objects. When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object. Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.\nKey Points In Global Scope the value of this is window. In function the value of this is window In Method the value of this is object function inside the method es5(deceleration function) the value of this is window. function inside the method es6(expression function) the value of this is object. the value of this in constructor function is blank object. In event listener value of this will be according to the element. call/apply/bind call There’s a special built-in function method func.call(context, …args) that allows to call a function explicitly setting this.\nThe syntax is:\nfunc.call(context, arg1, arg2, ...) It runs func providing the first argument as this, and the next as the arguments.\nTo put it simply, these two calls do almost the same:\nfunc(1, 2, 3); func.call(obj, 1, 2, 3) They both call func with arguments 1, 2 and 3. The only difference is that func.call also sets this to obj.\nAs an example, in the code below we call sayHi in the context of different objects: sayHi.call(user) runs sayHi providing this=user, and the next line sets this=admin:\nfunction sayHi() { alert(this.name); } let user = { name: \"John\" }; let admin = { name: \"Admin\" }; // use call to pass different objects as \"this\" sayHi.call( user ); // John sayHi.call( admin ); // Admin apply Instead of func.call(this, ...arguments) we could use func.apply(this, arguments).\nThe syntax of built-in method func.apply is:\nfunc.apply(context, args) It runs the func setting this=context and using an array-like object args as the list of arguments.\nThe only syntax difference between call and apply is that call expects a list of arguments, while apply takes an array-like object with them.\nSo these two calls are almost equivalent:\nfunc.call(context, ...args); func.apply(context, args); Example:\nfunction func(a, b, c) { console.log(this, a, b, c); } func.call(obj, [1, 2, 3]); bind() The bind() method of Function instances creates a new function that, when called, calls this function with its this keyword set to the provided value, and a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.\nIt does not call function. It just return another function that we can store in variable to call it\nfunction func() { console.log(this); } let n = func.bind(\"ahmad\"); n(); Prototypal inheritance In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property [[Prototype]] (as named in the specification), that is either null or references another object. That object is called “a prototype”:\nWhen we read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, this is called “prototypal inheritance”. And soon we’ll study many examples of such inheritance, as well as cooler language features built upon it.\nThe property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.\nPrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Instead of using classes like in classical inheritance (as in Java or C++), JavaScript uses prototypes.\nfunction makeHuman(name,age){ this.name = name; this.age = age; } makeHuman.prototype.greet = 12; makeHuman.prototype.func = function(){ console.log(this.name); } let human1 = new makeHuman(\"ahmad\",20); let human2 = new makeHuman(\"ali\",30); How It Works: Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which points to another object.\nWhen you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself.\nIf the property/method is not found, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it either finds the property or reaches null.\nThe value of “this” An interesting question may arise in the example above: what’s the value of this inside set fullName(value)? Where are the properties this.name and this.surname written: into user or admin?\nThe answer is simple: this is not affected by prototypes at all.\nNo matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, this is always the object before the dot.\nSo, the setter call admin.fullName= uses admin as this, not user.\nThat is actually a super-important thing, because we may have a big object with many methods, and have objects that inherit from it. And when the inheriting objects run the inherited methods, they will modify only their own states, not the state of the big object.\nClosures in JS A closure in JavaScript is a function that remembers the variables from its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.\nHow It Works: When a function is created inside another function, it captures the outer function’s variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.\nfunction counter() { let count = 0; return function() { count++; console.log(count); }; } const increment = counter(); increment(); // 1 increment(); // 2 What is an Event Listener in JavaScript? An event listener is a method that allows you to wait for a specific event (like a click, keypress, hover, etc.) and run a function when the event occurs.\n✅ Example of addEventListener() document.getElementById(\"btn\").addEventListener(\"click\", function() { console.log(\"Button Clicked!\"); }); Here, addEventListener(\"click\", function) listens for a click event on the button with id=\"btn\". When clicked, it logs \"Button Clicked!\". Common Events Event Description click When an element is clicked mouseover When the mouse hovers over an element keydown When a key is pressed submit When a form is submitted What is querySelector in JavaScript? querySelector() is a method used to select an element from the DOM using CSS selectors.\nExample of querySelector() const heading = document.querySelector(\"h1\"); // Selects the first `` element heading.style.color = \"red\"; // Changes its color to red Selecting Elements document.querySelector(\"#myId\"); // Selects an element by ID document.querySelector(\".myClass\"); // Selects the first element with this class document.querySelector(\"p\"); // Selects the first element Event Delegation in JavaScript Event Delegation is a pattern that allows you to handle events efficiently by attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding multiple listeners to child elements.\n🤔 Why Use Event Delegation? ✅ Better Performance → Avoids adding multiple event listeners.\n✅ Handles Dynamic Elements → Works even for elements added later via JavaScript.\n✅ Less Memory Usage → Reduces the number of event listeners.\nExample\nlet parent = document.querySelector(\"#parent\"); parent.addEventListener(\"click\", function (ev) { if (ev.target.id === \"play\") { console.log(\"Play Song\"); } else if (ev.target.id === \"pause\") { console.log(\"Pause Song\"); } }); When Should You Use Event Delegation? Handling clicks on lists, tables, menus, or dynamically added elements. Handling form inputs when adding fields dynamically. Improving performance for elements inside large containers. Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript A Higher-Order Function (HOF) is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.\nfunction func1(f1) { // func1 takes a function as an argument (HOF property) f1(); // Calls the passed function return function () { // Returns a new function (HOF property) console.log(\"returned fun\"); }; } fun = function () { console.log(\"Passed Function\"); }; let returned = func1(fun); // Call func1 with 'fun' function returned(); // Call the returned function Built-in Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript Method Description map() Transforms an array by applying a function to each element. filter() Filters an array based on a condition. reduce() Reduces an array to a single value. forEach() Iterates over an array but does not return a new one. Handling Errors with `try…catch The try...catch block allows you to handle errors gracefully. The try...catch statement is used to handle errors, and throw is used to create custom errors.\nBasic Example of try...catch\ntry { let x = y + 5; // ❌ ReferenceError: y is not defined } catch (error) { console.log(\"An error occurred:\", error.message); } 🔹 If an error occurs inside try, execution moves to catch, preventing a crash.\nUsing throw to Create Custom Error function divide(a, b) { if (b === 0) { throw new Error(\"Cannot divide by zero!\"); // 🚀 Custom error } return a / b; } try { console.log(divide(10, 0)); // ❌ Throws an error } catch (error) { console.log(\"Error:\", error.message); } 🔹 throw allows custom error messages instead of generic JavaScript errors.\nfinally Block (Always Executes) try { console.log(\"Trying something...\"); throw new Error(\"Something went wrong!\"); } catch (error) { console.log(\"Caught Error:\", error.message); } finally { console.log(\"This runs no matter what!\"); } Custom Events in JavaScript A Custom Event in JavaScript is an event that you manually create and dispatch using the CustomEvent constructor. This allows communication between different parts of your application.\nCreating and Dispatching a Custom Event The CustomEvent constructor takes two arguments: 1️⃣ Event Name (string)\n2️⃣ Event Options (optional, includes detail for extra data)\nlet ev = new Event(\"newEv\"); document.querySelector(\"button\").addEventListener(\"newEv\", function () { console.log(\"Custom Event\"); }); document.querySelector(\"button\").dispatchEvent(ev); Full Example: Custom Event with Data\n// Create and dispatch custom event const customEvent = new CustomEvent(\"userLoggedIn\", { detail: { username: \"ahmad9059\", role: \"admin\" } }); document.addEventListener(\"userLoggedIn\", function (event) { console.log(`User: ${event.detail.username}, Role: ${event.detail.role}`); }); // Dispatch the event document.dispatchEvent(customEvent); When to Use Custom Events?\nFor component communication (e.g., sending data between different UI components). When working with user interactions that don’t have built-in events. For event-driven architectures where actions trigger custom behavior.

A property is a “key: value” pair, where <code>key</code> is a string (also called a “property name”), and <code>value</code> can be anything.</p><p>We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.</p><p>An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>let</span> user <span style=color:#ff79c6>=</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>new</span> <span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>Object</span>(); <span style=color:#6272a4>// &#34;object constructor&#34; syntax

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why does the <code>in</code> operator exist? Isn’t it enough to compare against <code>undefined</code>?</p><p>Well, most of the time the comparison with <code>undefined</code> works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but <code>"in"</code> works correctly.</p><p>It’s when an object property exists, but stores <code>undefined</code>:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>let</span> obj <span style=color:#ff79c6>=</span> {

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the code above, the property <code>obj.test</code> technically exists. So the <code>in</code> operator works right.</p><p>Situations like this happen very rarely, because <code>undefined</code> should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use <code>null</code> for “unknown” or “empty” values. So the <code>in</code> operator is an exotic guest in the code.</p><h2 id=the-forin-loop>The &ldquo;for..in&rdquo; loop<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-forin-loop>#</a></h2><p>To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: <code>for..in</code>.

That object is called “a prototype”:</p><p>When we read a property from <code>object</code>, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, this is called “prototypal inheritance”.

Where are the properties <code>this.name</code> and <code>this.surname</code> written: into <code>user</code> or <code>admin</code>?</p><p>The answer is simple: <code>this</code> is not affected by prototypes at all.</p><p><strong>No matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, <code>this</code> is always the object before the dot.</strong></p><p>So, the setter call <code>admin.fullName=</code> uses <code>admin</code> as <code>this</code>, not <code>user</code>.</p><p>That is actually a super-important thing, because we may have a big object with many methods, and have objects that inherit from it. And when the inheriting objects run the inherited methods, they will modify only their own states, not the state of the big object.</p><h1 id=closures-in-js>Closures in JS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#closures-in-js>#</a></h1><p>A <strong>closure</strong> in JavaScript is a function that remembers the variables from its <strong>lexical scope</strong>, even when the function is executed outside that scope.</p><h3 id=how-it-works-1>How It Works:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-it-works-1>#</a></h3><p>When a function is created inside another function, it <strong>captures</strong> the outer function’s variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>function</span> counter() {
