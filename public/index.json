[{"content":"Shell Scripting A shell script is an executable text file that contains shells commands and other specific programming structures.\nWhat is a Shell? A shell is a program that acts as a bridge(interface) between you(user) and the operating system(kernel). It takes commands you type, sends them to the operating system kernel, and then shows you the output. Think of it as a command interpreter. Tip: Use this command to check your current shell\n# Method-1 echo $0 #Method-2 echo $SHELL What is Bash? Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell. It is one specific type of shell, widely used in Linux and macOS. It adds features like command history, tab completion, scripting support, etc. Other shells exist (sh, zsh, fish), but Bash is the most common. Tip: Check all shells in your system\ncat /etc/shells Tip: You can change your shell by using the following\nchsh -s /path/to/shell # Example chsh -s /bin/bash What is a Terminal? A terminal is the program you open to interact with the shell. Examples: GNOME Terminal, Kitty (which you use), Alacritty, Ghostty. The terminal itself does not understand commands. It just provides a window for you to type in, and then it forwards what you type to the shell. 👉 Relationship: Terminal → Window/Interface Shell → Program running inside terminal Bash → One type of shell Create First Script A script is just a text file with commands written in order.\nCreate a file: vim hello.sh Add the shebang (tells the system which interpreter to use): #!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; Make it executable: chmod +x hello.sh Run it: # Method-1 ./hello.sh # Method-2 bash hello.sh PATH in Shell PATH is an environment variable that stores directories where the shell looks for executable commands. Format: Colon-separated list of directories. Example:\necho $PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/user/bin Usage: When you type a command like ls, the shell searches for it in directories listed in PATH.\nWorking with PATH View PATH echo $PATH Temporarily add a directory (only in current session) # Syntax export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir_file #Example export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/scripts Not I don\u0026rsquo;t used the \u0026quot;\u0026quot; because there is not between them but good to use them.\nPermanently add (add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.profile) export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/opt/custom/bin\u0026#34; Run script without changing PATH\nUse relative path: ./myscript.sh\nUse absolute path: /home/user/scripts/myscript.sh\nWhat is a Shebang (#!)? The shebang is the first line in a script, written as #!.\nIt tells the system which interpreter should run the file.\nExample:\n#!/bin/bash Note: Without shebang, the system may use the default shell (sometimes /bin/sh), which can behave differently from Bash.\nTip: # (hash) !(exclamation/bang) combine become hash bang so the sort term is shebang\nWhy Shebang is Important? Ensures your script runs in the correct shell, no matter who runs it. Makes scripts portable and predictable. Example: #!/bin/bash → Runs with Bash. #!/bin/sh → Runs with default POSIX shell. #!/usr/bin/env python3 → Runs with Python. Example\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import sys print(sys.version) print(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;) This is python code but the python3 interpreter is used because the shebang tell the used that one.\nComments in Shell Scripts Purpose: Add explanations, notes, or disable code without execution. Symbol: # (hash). Everything after # on a line is ignored by the shell. Types of Comments Single-line comment # This is a single-line comment echo \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; # Inline comment after a command Multi-line comment (common hack) : \u0026#39; This is a multi-line comment It can span across lines \u0026#39; (Uses : which is a no-op command, followed by a quoted block)\nDifferent Way to Run the Script 1. ./script.sh Runs the script as a separate executable program. Requires execute permission (chmod +x script.sh). Uses the shebang line (#!) at the top of the script to decide which interpreter runs it. Runs in a new shell process, so variables/functions don’t affect the current shell. ./script.sh 2. source script.sh (or . script.sh) Reads and executes the script inside the current shell. No need for execute permission. Ignores the shebang, always runs in the current shell. Any variables/functions defined in the script stay available after it finishes. source script.sh 3. bash script.sh Runs the script using the bash interpreter explicitly. Doesn’t require execute permission. Runs in a new shell process (like ./script.sh). Ignores the shebang, always uses bash. bash script.sh Quick Comparison Table Command Needs chmod +x? Uses Shebang? Runs in new shell? Variables persist? ./script.sh ✅ Yes ✅ Yes ✅ Yes ❌ No source script.sh ❌ No ❌ No ❌ No (same shell) ✅ Yes bash script.sh ❌ No ❌ No (always bash) ✅ Yes ❌ No ⚡ Rule of thumb:\nUse ./script.sh for normal scripts. Use source script.sh only when you want to load functions/variables into your current shell session. Use bash script.sh when you want to force bash, ignoring the shebang. Steps of Command Processing Read Input From terminal (interactive use) or file/script. Reads line by line. Tokenization (Lexical Analysis) Breaks input into words and operators. Follows specific syntax rules. Alias expansion happens at this stage. Parsing / Command Identification Tokens are recognized as: Simple commands (like ls -l) Compound commands (like if, for, pipelines, etc.) Shell Expansions (performed in order): Brace expansion → {a,b,c} → expands to a b c Tilde expansion → ~ → expands to home directory Parameter \u0026amp; variable expansion → $VAR Command substitution → `command` or $(command) Arithmetic expansion → $((2+3)) → 5 Process substitution → \u0026lt;(command) or \u0026gt;(command) Word splitting → breaks expanded words into fields Filename expansion (globbing) → *.txt → matches files Quote Removal Removes \u0026quot; ' and ` while preserving meaning. Redirections Handles input/output redirection, e.g. \u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt; 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1. Execution The command is executed. If required, the shell waits for the command to finish. Exit status ($?) is collected.

When you type a command and press Enter, the shell performs several steps before execution. After tokenization, Command Identification (splitting the command into words/tokens) and parsing, the shell performs expansions. Expansion = the process of replacing symbols, variables, or patterns with their actual values. Example:\necho $HOME Here $HOME is expanded into your actual home directory path (like /home/ahmad).\nOrder of Shell Expansions Bash applies expansions in a specific order:\nBrace Expansion { } Tilde Expansion ~ Parameter and Variable Expansion $VAR Command Substitution `cmd` or $(cmd) Arithmetic Expansion $(( expression )) Process Substitution \u0026lt;(cmd) or \u0026gt;(cmd) Word Splitting Filename Expansion (Globbing) * ? [] Quote Removal After expansions, quote removal is performed. Meaning: surrounding quotes (\u0026quot;, ') are stripped, but they influence whether expansions like word splitting or globbing happen. Brace Expansion in Shell (String List) Brace Expansion Brace expansion is a feature in Bash that allows you to generate arbitrary strings. It is not variable expansion or filename expansion, but rather a way to produce multiple strings at once. Example: echo {old,new,current,backup} Output:\nold new current backup Types of Brace Expansion There are two types:\nString lists → comma-separated items inside {} Range/sequence lists → numeric or character ranges (covered later) General Syntax (String List Form) [prefix]{item1,item2,item3,...}[suffix] Prefix → optional string before braces. Suffix → optional string after braces. Items → comma-separated list inside braces. Example:\necho 01-{old,new,current,backup}.txt Output:\n01-old.txt 01-new.txt 01-current.txt 01-backup.txt Using Brace Expansion with Commands Brace expansions are not limited to echo. They can be used with any command:\nCreate files:\ntouch {old,new,current,backup}.txt Remove files:\nrm {old,new,current,backup}.txt Rules and Restrictions No spaces allowed around commas: echo {a, b} # Wrong → prints {a, b} echo {a,b} # Correct → prints a b Must have unquoted { } and at least one unquoted comma. Incorrectly formed expansions are left unchanged: echo \u0026#34;{a,b}\u0026#34; # Prints {a,b}, no expansion Nested Brace Expansions Brace expansions can be nested inside each other:\necho {old,new}-{10,20,30} Output:\nold-10 old-20 old-30 new-10 new-20 new-30 Expansion is performed from left to right. Brace Expansion in Shell (Ranges / Sequences) What is Sequence Brace Expansion? It generates a contiguous range of numbers or letters. General form: {start..end[..step]} Works for integers and characters (letters). Basic Examples\nNumbers: echo {1..5} Output:\n1 2 3 4 5 Letters:\necho {A..L} Output:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L echo {A..Z} Output:\nA B C ... X Y Z Increment (Step Value) You can specify a step size. echo {1..20..2} Output:\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 By default, step = 1. Zero Padding If a number starts with 0, Bash pads all numbers to the same width. echo {01..10} Output:\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 Also\necho {005..010} Output:\n005 006 007 008 009 010 Reverse Sequences You can reverse the order.\necho {10..1} Output:\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Also\necho {Z..A} Output:\nZ Y X W V ... C B A Restrictions Both values must be the same type:\n✅ Numbers with numbers ✅ Letters with letters ❌ Cannot mix letters and numbers: echo {1..A} # Invalid, stays unchanged Expansion Order (Important) Brace expansion happens before variable expansion. This means you cannot use variables inside brace ranges. A=1 echo {$A..50} # ❌ Does NOT work The shell tries to expand braces before replacing $A.\nTilde Expansion in Shell After brace expansion, the shell performs tilde expansion. The ~ symbol is expanded to represent home directories and certain working directories. Common Expansions Current user’s home directory echo ~ cd ~ Expands to $HOME (example: /home/ahmad).\nSpecific user’s home directory echo ~root Expands to /root.\nCurrent working directory echo ~+ Expands to $PWD.\nPrevious working directory echo ~- Expands to $OLDPWD.\nIf $OLDPWD is not set, ~- does not expand. Directory stack entries (advanced, when using pushd / popd) ~N → Nth directory from the directory stack. ~-N → Nth entry counting from the right. Parameter and Variable Expansion Use $ before a variable name: os=linux echo $os echo ${os} Both output:\nlinux Why braces {}?\nTo protect the variable name when followed by characters. echo $osmint # tries to expand $osmint (doesn’t exist) echo ${os}mint # expands $os + \u0026#34;mint\u0026#34; → linuxmint Case Modification Operators Uppercase all letters: echo ${os^^} → LINUX\nLowercase all letters: echo ${os,,} → linux\nNote: (Single ^ or , affects only the first character.)\nDefault Value Substitution a) Use default if variable is unset/null:\nping -c 3 ${ip:-1.1.1.1} If $ip exists → use its value. If $ip doesn’t exist → use 1.1.1.1. b) Assign default if variable is unset/null:\nping -c 3 ${ip:=8.8.4.4} If $ip is not set → assign 8.8.4.4 to it. Now $ip has this value permanently in the script. Perfect, that transcript is walking you through Command Substitution in shell scripting.\nHere are the detailed notes you can keep:\nCommand Substitution in Shell Command substitution allows you to run a command and use its output as a value inside your script. Think of it as replacing the command with its result. Extremely useful for dynamic values like dates, usernames, process lists, etc. Syntax There are two ways (both valid):\na) Backticks `command` (older form) now=`date` echo \u0026#34;$now\u0026#34; b) Dollar-parentheses $(command) (modern, preferred) now=$(date) echo \u0026#34;$now\u0026#34; ✅ Both execute date and store its output in now.\n✅ The second form is clearer, supports nesting, and is more common in modern scripts.\nBest Practices with Quotes Always wrap the substitution in double quotes. now=\u0026#34;$(date)\u0026#34; Why? To prevent word splitting and filename expansion on the output. Without quotes, spaces in the output can break your script. Examples Store date in variable now=$(date) echo \u0026#34;The time is: $now\u0026#34; Count logged-in users users=$(who) echo \u0026#34;Users logged in: $users\u0026#34; Using pipelines in substitution bash_processes=$(ps -ef | grep bash) echo \u0026#34;$bash_processes\u0026#34; Archive with timestamp in filename tar -czf etc-$(date +%F-%H%M).tar.gz /etc %F → YYYY-MM-DD %H → Hour (00-23) %M → Minute Result: etc-2025-09-11-1021.tar.gz\nOverwriting vs unique files Without substitution → archive overwrites on rerun. With substitution → new file each run (different name due to timestamp). Why prefer $(command) over backticks? Easier to read. Can nest commands: echo \u0026#34;Today is $(date +%A), user count: $(who | wc -l)\u0026#34; Backticks `...` require escaping and become messy in nested cases. Summary Command substitution = replace command with its output. Syntax: `command` or $(command) (preferred). Always quote results \u0026quot;$(command)\u0026quot;. Useful for logging, filenames, conditional logic, and dynamic input. Arithmetic Expansion in Shell Scripting $(( expression )) Everything inside (( )) is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. The result replaces the expression in the command line. Example:\nx=$((7 * 9)) echo $x # 63 Key Points Tokens inside the expression undergo: Parameter expansion (variables are expanded) Command substitution (commands inside will execute first) Quote removal Operators \u0026amp; precedence\nSame as in C or other languages: + - * / % (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus) ** (power/exponentiation) Comparison (\u0026lt;, \u0026gt;, \u0026lt;=, \u0026gt;=, ==, !=) Logical (\u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ||, !) Assignment (=, +=, -=, etc.) Examples echo $((2 + 3 * 4)) # 14 echo $((2 ** 8)) # 256 Using let The let built-in command also evaluates arithmetic:\nlet y=2**8 echo $y # 256 Limitations Only integers are supported No floating-point numbers in Bash arithmetic. Example: echo $((5 / 2)) # 2, not 2.5 Overflow possible If a number exceeds the system’s max integer size, it wraps around or becomes zero. Example: echo $((2 ** 128)) # Overflow → result invalid Decimal (Floating-Point) Calculations with bc For real numbers, use bc (Basic Calculator).\nPipe to bc echo \u0026#34;3 * 7\u0026#34; | bc # 21 Division with scale echo \u0026#34;scale=2; 11 / 4\u0026#34; | bc # 2.75 scale=n → number of decimal places to show. Using Here String bc \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;scale=3; 23 / 7\u0026#34; # 3.285 Interactive mode bc # Then type expressions manually Summary\nUse $(( )) for integer math in scripts. Use let as an alternative. For floating-point or high-precision math, use bc. Process Substitution in Shell Process substitution allows you to treat the output of a command as if it were a file. In Linux, \u0026ldquo;everything is a file\u0026rdquo;, so the shell can represent command output internally as a temporary file (often in /dev/fd/). Example:\ncat \u0026lt;(ls) \u0026lt;(ls) runs ls, creates a file descriptor with the output, and cat reads it like a file. Syntax Input form: \u0026lt;(command) Note: The output of command becomes a file-like input.\nOutput form: \u0026gt;(command) The output of your program is sent as input to command. Note: No space between \u0026lt; or \u0026gt; and the parentheses.\n\u0026lt;(ls) # ✅ valid \u0026lt; (ls) # ❌ error Basic Example echo \u0026lt;(ls) Prints something like: /dev/fd/63 (a file descriptor). cat \u0026lt;(ls) Prints the actual content of ls (directory listing). Practical Example: Comparing Directories You want to compare filenames in two directories:\nmkdir dir1 dir2 touch dir1/a dir1/b dir2/a dir2/c # Compare contents of dir1 and dir2 diff \u0026lt;(ls dir1) \u0026lt;(ls dir2) Output:\n1d0 \u0026lt; b 1a2 \u0026gt; c Shows that b is only in dir1 and c is only in dir2. 5. Why Use Process Substitution? Lets you use commands that normally expect files as input, but instead give them command output. Avoids creating temporary files with \u0026gt; redirection. Useful in loops, arrays, and comparisons. Real-World Use Cases Compare process lists: diff \u0026lt;(ps -ef | sort) \u0026lt;(ps -ef | sort -r) Feed multiple commands into paste: paste \u0026lt;(ls dir1) \u0026lt;(ls dir2) Sorting and comparing logs: diff \u0026lt;(sort file1.log) \u0026lt;(sort file2.log) Notes Available in Bash, Zsh, Ksh, but not in POSIX sh. Internally uses named pipes (FIFOs) or /dev/fd. Very powerful with tools like diff, comm, paste. Summary\nProcess substitution = treat command output like a file. Syntax: \u0026lt;(command) or \u0026gt;(command) (no space). Useful for comparisons, loops, avoiding temp files. Works with commands that require filenames instead of STDIN. Word Splitting, explained Word splitting is the shell step that breaks the result of unquoted expansions into separate words, using the IFS variable as delimiters. It happens after brace expansion, tilde, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and process substitution, but before filename expansion (globbing) and quote removal.\nIFS (Internal Field Separator) Default value, contains space, tab, newline (these are invisible characters). IFS defines the delimiters used for splitting. You can view IFS in a readable way, for example: # show escapes for whitespace characters printf \u0026#39;%s\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#34;${IFS@Q}\u0026#34; # or echo \u0026#34;$IFS\u0026#34; | sed -n \u0026#39;l\u0026#39; Basic behavior, examples Unquoted expansion is split, quoted expansion is not dirs=\u0026#34;d1 d2 d3\u0026#34; mkdir $dirs # unquoted, word splitting creates 3 dirs: d1, d2, d3 mkdir \u0026#34;$dirs\u0026#34; # quoted, creates a single dir named \u0026#34;d1 d2 d3\u0026#34; Change IFS to split on other characters oldIFS=$IFS IFS=\u0026#39;:\u0026#39; dirs=\u0026#34;d1:d2:d3\u0026#34; mkdir $dirs # creates d1, d2, d3 because IFS is \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; IFS=$oldIFS # restore original IFS Tip, temporary change in a subshell:\n( IFS=\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;; mkdir $dirs ) # IFS change scoped to subshell Special behavior, important gotchas When IFS contains whitespace (default), consecutive whitespace is treated as a single delimiter, and leading/trailing whitespace is ignored. Example: s=\u0026#34; a b c \u0026#34; set -- $s # with default IFS printf \u0026#39;[%s]\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; # prints [a] [b] [c] When IFS contains non-whitespace characters (for example :), adjacent delimiters create empty fields. Example: IFS=\u0026#39;:\u0026#39; s=\u0026#34;a::b\u0026#34; set -- $s printf \u0026#39;[%s]\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; # prints [a] [] [b], note the empty element Word splitting is applied to the results of unquoted expansions only. If you want to avoid splitting, quote the expansion: \u0026quot;$var\u0026quot;. Unquoted expansions are also subject to filename expansion (globbing) after splitting. Example risk: names=\u0026#34;*.txt\u0026#34; rm $names # could expand and delete files rm \u0026#34;$names\u0026#34; # removes a file literally named \u0026#34;*.txt\u0026#34;, or fails if none Common, safe patterns 1) Forward script arguments safely # preserve argument boundaries, even with spaces some_command \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; 2) Split into an array safely IFS=\u0026#39;:\u0026#39; read -ra parts \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;$PATH\u0026#34; # now ${parts[0]}, ${parts[1]}, ... are PATH elements Use -r to prevent backslash escape interpretation, -a to populate an array.\n3) Temporarily change IFS without side effects oldIFS=$IFS IFS=\u0026#39;,\u0026#39; # do work that requires comma splitting IFS=$oldIFS or use a subshell, ( IFS=','; ... ).\nSummary, short rules Word splitting happens only on unquoted expansion results. Default IFS = space, tab, newline. Change it if you need other delimiters. Prefer \u0026quot;$var\u0026quot; to avoid accidental splitting and globbing, unless you intentionally want splitting. Use \u0026quot;$@\u0026quot; to forward arguments safely. Use read -ra or array read patterns to split into arrays safely. Be mindful of whitespace vs non-whitespace IFS differences, they behave differently with adjacent delimiters. Filename Expansion (Globbing) in Shell What is Globbing? Globbing is the process where the shell expands special characters into matching filenames or paths. It happens after word splitting in the expansion order. Works in any command (ls, rm, cp, etc). If the pattern does not match any file, behavior depends on the shell: In bash (default): the pattern is kept literally. With shopt -s nullglob, unmatched patterns expand to nothing. Special Globbing Characters Asterisk (*) Matches zero or more characters. Example: ls f* → matches f, fa.txt, foo.txt, etc.\nNote: Hidden files (starting with .) are not matched unless explicitly included: ls .* Question Mark (?) Matches exactly one character. Example: ls fa?.txt → matches fa1.txt, fab.txt, but not fa10.txt. → it work as placeholder so you can add multiple ? to match pattern like\nls fa??.txt # Output fa10.txt # any two place file It has two placeholder here that match anything in ? part\nSquare Brackets ([]) Matches one character from a set or range. Examples: ls fa[123].txt # matches fa1.txt, fa2.txt, fa3.txt ls fa[a-c].txt # matches faa.txt, fab.txt, fac.txt You can use ranges: [a-z] → lowercase letters [A-Z] → uppercase letters [0-9] → digits Negation inside [] [^...] or [!... ] matches any single character not in the set.\nExample:\nls fa[^0-9].txt → matches faa.txt but not fa3.txt.\nImportant Notes Quoting prevents globbing: ls \u0026#34;fa*.txt\u0026#34; → searches for a file literally named fa*.txt (no expansion).\nAlways test dangerous commands (like rm) with echo first: echo fa*.txt rm fa*.txt Summary:\n* → zero or more chars ? → exactly one char [abc] → match a, b, or c [a-z] → range match [^...] or [!... ] → negation ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/shell-expansion/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"shell-expansion\"\u003eShell Expansion\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Section we are going to learn about Shell Expansion, How bash perform the Shell Expansion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-expansion\"\u003eWhat is Expansion?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen you type a command and press \u003cstrong\u003eEnter\u003c/strong\u003e, the shell performs several steps before execution.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter \u003cstrong\u003etokenization\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eCommand Identification\u003c/strong\u003e (splitting the command into words/tokens) and parsing, the shell performs \u003cstrong\u003eexpansions\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpansion\u003c/strong\u003e = the process of replacing symbols, variables, or patterns with their actual values.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic\"\u003eecho\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic\"\u003e$HOME\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere \u003ccode\u003e$HOME\u003c/code\u003e is \u003cstrong\u003eexpanded\u003c/strong\u003e into your actual home directory path (like \u003ccode\u003e/home/ahmad\u003c/code\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Shell Expansion in Shell Scripting"},{"content":"Shell Operation in Bash The shell (e.g., bash) follows a multi-step process to interpret and execute commands.

Parsing / Command Identification Tokens are recognized as: Simple commands (like ls -l) Compound commands (like if, for, pipelines, etc.) Shell Expansions (performed in order): Brace expansion → {a,b,c} → expands to a b c Tilde expansion → ~ → expands to home directory Parameter \u0026amp; variable expansion → $VAR Command substitution → `command` or $(command) Arithmetic expansion → $((2+3)) → 5 Process substitution → \u0026lt;(command) or \u0026gt;(command) Word splitting → breaks expanded words into fields Filename expansion (globbing) → *.txt → matches files Quote Removal Removes \u0026quot; ' and ` while preserving meaning. Redirections Handles input/output redirection, e.g. \u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt; 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1. Execution The command is executed. If required, the shell waits for the command to finish. Exit status ($?) is collected. Key Points Tokenization is the first transformation stage. Expansions are ordered; each depends on the result of the previous. Redirection happens before execution. Exit status is important for scripting (conditional logic). Shell Tokenization Definition: The process of breaking input into tokens (smallest meaningful units). A token = sequence of characters treated as a single unit by the shell. How Tokenization Works Input Source From terminal or a file (script). Meta Characters Special unquoted characters that separate words. List of meta characters: Space ( ) Tab (\\t) Newline (\\n) | \u0026amp; ; ( ) \u0026lt; \u0026gt; Types of Tokens Words: tokens without unquoted meta characters. Operators: tokens containing at least one unquoted meta character. Note: If quoted, they lose their special meaning.\nOperators Control Operators → Perform control functions. Examples: ; \u0026amp; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; || | |\u0026amp; ( ) \\n Redirection Operators → Redirect input/output. Examples: \u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026gt;\u0026amp; \u0026lt;\u0026amp; \u0026gt;| ⚠️ Operators matter only if unquoted.\nAlias Expansion Aliases are expanded at this step, during tokenization. Example Walkthrough Command:\nls $Home \u0026gt; Home.txt Identify meta characters Only spaces ( ) here. Split into tokens (4 tokens): ls $Home \u0026gt; Home.txt Classify tokens: Words → ls, $Home, Home.txt Operator → \u0026gt; (redirection) Hidden Control Operator: Newline (\\n) at the end of the command. Key Points to Remember $ is not a meta character → $Home counts as a word. Redirection operators (\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;) do not split commands, but control operators (;, \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, newline) do. Tokenization always happens before parsing and expansions. Shell Command Identification After Tokenization Shell now classifies tokens into simple or compound commands. Simple Commands Definition: Sequence of words separated by spaces, terminated by newline or a control operator. Structure: First word → command name. Remaining words → arguments. Examples: touch a.txt b.txt c.txt touch = command name a.txt b.txt c.txt = arguments Terminated by invisible newline. ⚠️ Important Notes If multiple commands are written without control operators, shell may treat them as one simple command. touch a.txt b.txt ls → Interpreted as touch with args a.txt b.txt ls (not two commands).\nUse a control operator like ; to separate them: touch a.txt b.txt ; ls → Now touch and ls are two simple commands.\nCompound Commands Definition: Commands that start and end with reserved words (bash keywords).\nReserved words examples:\nif … fi while … done for … do … done case … esac Check reserved word:\ntype if # reserved word type elif # reserved word type ls # normal command Features: Can span multiple lines. Contain both simple and compound commands inside. Used for programming constructs: conditions, loops, iterations. Example: if [ -f /etc/passwd ]; then tail -n 3 /etc/passwd fi if starts compound command. fi ends it. Inside: a test + a simple command (tail). Recap After tokenization → shell does command identification. Simple command = list of words, first word = command name, rest = arguments, terminated by newline/control operator. Compound command = starts \u0026amp; ends with reserved words, represents programming constructs (if, while, for, etc.). Next stage after identification = Shell Expansions. Shell Expansions Expansion happens after tokenization and command identification. Definition: Expansion is the procedure of replacing a reference with its actual value. Example: echo $HOME $HOME → expanded into /home/ahmad (actual value). Types of Expansions (in order) Brace Expansion { } Generates arbitrary strings. Example: echo file{1..3} # file1 file2 file3 Tilde Expansion ~ Expands to home directories. Example: echo ~ # /home/ahmad Parameter and Variable Expansion $VAR Expands variables, parameters, special vars. Example: echo $USER Command Substitution $( ) or ` ` Runs a command and replaces it with the output. Example: echo \u0026#34;Today is $(date)\u0026#34; Arithmetic Expansion $(( )) Evaluates arithmetic expressions. Example: echo $((2 + 3)) # 5 Process Substitution \u0026lt;( ) , \u0026gt;( ) Treats command output/input like a file. Example: diff \u0026lt;(ls dir1) \u0026lt;(ls dir2) Word Splitting Splits results of expansion into multiple words (based on $IFS). Example: VAR=\u0026#34;a b c\u0026#34; echo $VAR # a b c Filename Expansion (Globbing) Expands wildcard characters (*, ?, [ ]). Example: echo *.txt # lists all .txt files After Expansions Quote removal is performed. This removes quotes \u0026quot; ' ` but keeps the expanded values. Recap Expansions = replace references with values. There are 8 types, executed in a strict order. Final step after all expansions = quote removal. Quote Removal in Bash Quote removal is performed after shell expansions.\nPurpose: remove the quoting characters that were only used to control interpretation.\nAll unquoted occurrences of:\nBackslash (\\) Single quotes (') Double quotes (\u0026quot;) These are removed if they did not result from an expansion.\nWhy are quotes/backslashes removed? Quotes/backslashes temporarily remove the special meaning of characters. Once the shell has interpreted them, they are no longer needed and are removed. Examples Prevent variable expansion with backslash: echo \\$USER Output:\n$USER The backslash was removed during quote removal. Printing quotes literally: echo \u0026#39;single quotes\u0026#39; \u0026#34;Linux in double quotes\u0026#34; Single quotes are removed. Double quotes remain if they were quoted. Variable containing backslashes: dir=\u0026#34;C:\\Windows\\System\u0026#34; echo $dir Backslashes remain. Reason: they came from variable expansion, not from quoting. Key Rule Only unquoted backslashes, single quotes, and double quotes are removed, and only if they are not generated by an expansion. Shell Redirections Command Processing Context After quote removal, the last step in command line processing is redirections. Redirections control where input comes from and where output goes. Standard Data Streams Every shell command has three default streams, identified by numbers (file descriptors):\n0 → stdin (Standard Input)\nInput to the program (keyboard by default). 1 → stdout (Standard Output) 2 → stderr (Standard Error)\nError messages (screen by default). These numbers (0, 1, 2) are file descriptors opened each time a command runs.\nStandard Input Redirection (\u0026lt;) Redirects input from a file instead of keyboard. Example: tail \u0026lt; /etc/group cat \u0026lt; /etc/passwd Many commands that accept a filename as an argument will read from stdin if no file is provided. Standard Output Redirection (\u0026gt;) Redirects command output to a file instead of screen. Example: ls -l \u0026gt; ls.txt Behavior: Creates file if it doesn’t exist. Overwrites file if it already exists. Example overwrite: ip addr \u0026gt; ls.txt # overwrites ls.txt, removes previous ls -l output Append Redirection (\u0026gt;\u0026gt;) Appends output to the end of a file instead of overwriting it. Example: ls -l \u0026gt;\u0026gt; output.txt ip addr \u0026gt;\u0026gt; output.txt Behavior: Creates file if it doesn’t exist. Appends if file exists. Everything is a File in Linux Even terminals are represented as files. Check terminal device: tty # Output: /dev/pts/0 Redirect output to another terminal: ip addr \u0026gt; /dev/pts/0 Result: Output appears in the other terminal window (like basic instant messaging). Shell Redirections (Part 2: stderr, combining, tee) File Descriptors Recap stdin (0) → standard input stdout (1) → standard output stderr (2) → standard error By default:\n\u0026gt; = redirects stdout (fd 1). To redirect stderr, you must explicitly specify 2\u0026gt;. Redirecting Standard Error Example command that generates error: tail -n3 /etc/shadow (normal users cannot read it)\nRedirect stderr:\ntail -n3 /etc/shadow 2\u0026gt; error.txt No spaces between 2 and \u0026gt;.\nCreates file if missing, overwrites if exists.\nAppend stderr:\ntail -n3 /etc/shadow 2\u0026gt;\u0026gt; error.txt Redirecting stdout and stderr Separately Redirect outputs to different files: tail -n2 /etc/passwd /etc/shadow \u0026gt; output.txt 2\u0026gt; errors.txt output.txt → normal command output. errors.txt → error messages. Redirecting stdout and stderr to Same File Redirect stdout to file, stderr to stdout: tail -n2 /etc/passwd /etc/shadow \u0026gt; output_errors.txt 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 Explanation: 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 → redirect stderr (2) to wherever stdout (1) is going. Ampersand (\u0026amp;) indicates stream reference, not a filename. Without \u0026amp;, it would create a file literally called 1. Redirections with Pipes You can still combine with pipes (|). Example: extract MAC address: ifconfig | grep ether | cut -d\u0026#34; \u0026#34; -f10 \u0026gt; mac.txt cut -d \u0026quot; \u0026quot; -f10 → splits by space, picks 10th field (MAC address). The tee Command Problem: normal redirection saves to file but hides from terminal. tee solves this by splitting output (like a plumbing T-junction). Examples:\nSave and display: ifconfig | grep ether | tee mac.txt Displays on screen + saves to mac.txt. Append mode: who | tee -a mac.txt Save to multiple files: uname -r | tee -a mac.txt kernel.txt Key Points 2\u0026gt; → redirect stderr. \u0026gt; defaults to stdout (1). 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 → merge stderr into stdout. Redirections work with pipes. tee → write to file(s) and screen simultaneously. Bash Redirection \u0026amp; Pipe Cheat Sheet Symbol / Command Meaning Example Notes \u0026lt; Redirect stdin (input) sort \u0026lt; file.txt Reads input from file instead of keyboard \u0026gt; Redirect stdout (overwrite) echo hello \u0026gt; out.txt Creates or overwrites file \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Redirect stdout (append) echo hi \u0026gt;\u0026gt; out.txt Adds to file, keeps existing content 2\u0026gt; Redirect stderr (overwrite) ls /root 2\u0026gt; errors.txt Errors go to file 2\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Redirect stderr (append) ls /root 2\u0026gt;\u0026gt; errors.txt Errors appended \u0026amp;\u0026gt; Redirect both stdout + stderr cmd \u0026amp;\u0026gt; all.txt Equivalent to \u0026gt; all.txt 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 (bash-specific) 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 Redirect stderr to stdout ls /root \u0026gt; all.txt 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 Merge both into same file ` ` (pipe) Send stdout of one cmd as stdin to another `ls `cmd 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 cmd2` Pipe stdout+stderr to next command `ls /root 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 tee Split output → screen + file `ls tee list.txt` tee -a Append mode for tee `ls tee -a list.txt` tee file1 file2 Write to multiple files `ls tee f1 f2` ⚡ Quick Notes: File Descriptors (FDs): 0 → stdin 1 → stdout 2 → stderr No spaces allowed between FD number and operator:\n✅ 2\u0026gt; file.txt\n❌ 2 \u0026gt; file.txt Without number: \u0026gt; = 1\u0026gt; (stdout). Detailed Example, Step-By-Step, How Bash Processes This Command Example command (from the video), written exactly:\nls $HOME \u0026gt; $(date +%H_%M).txt 1) Tokenization Shell looks for unquoted meta characters (space, tab, newline, and the special symbols), to split the input into tokens.\nIn this command there are two unquoted meta characters, space and \u0026gt;.\nImportant: the space inside $(date +%H_%M) does not count, because it is inside a command substitution, so it is treated as part of a single token.\nTokens produced:\nls $HOME \u0026gt; $(date +%H_%M).txt Classification, after tokenization:\nWords (no unquoted meta chars): ls, $HOME, $(date +%H_%M).txt Operator (contains an unquoted meta char): \u0026gt; Note: $ is not a meta character, so $HOME remains a single word token.\n2) Command identification The shell identifies the command type, simple or compound. This command is a simple command, because it does not start with a reserved word (if, while, for, etc). A simple command is terminated by a control operator or the invisible newline at the end of the line. Here the newline (end of line) terminates the command. \u0026gt; is a redirection operator, not a control operator, so it stays part of the same simple command. 3) Expansions (performed in strict order) Bash runs expansions in this order, only some apply here:\nBrace expansion Tilde expansion Parameter and variable expansion Command substitution Arithmetic expansion Process substitution Word splitting Filename expansion (globbing) In our example, the relevant expansions are: Parameter expansion: $HOME → /home/student (example value) Command substitution: $(date +%H_%M) → 11_16 (example output, hour_minute) After those expansions, the command becomes: ls /home/student \u0026gt; 11_16.txt 4) Word splitting and filename expansion, then quote removal Word splitting: bash will split expansion results into words based on $IFS (by default space, tab, newline), but only for expansions not inside double quotes. In this example, neither expansion produced spaces, so no splitting occurs. Filename expansion (globbing): only happens if there are unquoted wildcard characters (* ? [ ]) in the words, none here. Quote removal: any remaining unquoted backslashes, single quotes, double quotes that were not produced by expansions are removed. There are none here, so nothing is removed. 5) Redirections Shell inspects redirection operators and sets up file descriptors before executing the command. Here the single greater-than \u0026gt; is present, so: stdout (fd 1) is redirected to the file 11_16.txt. If 11_16.txt does not exist, bash creates it. If it exists, bash overwrites it (use \u0026gt;\u0026gt; to append instead). After setting up the redirection, the command is ready to run. Execution Bash executes ls with argument /home/student. The ls output goes to the file 11_16.txt (because stdout was redirected). Bash waits for the command to finish, then collects its exit status. Quick checklist, with the most important rules illustrated by this example Meta characters only act when unquoted (spaces inside $(...) are ignored for tokenization). $ is not a meta character, it is part of words until parameter expansion runs. Command substitution is treated as a single token during tokenization. Expansions occur in a fixed order, parameter and command substitution happen before word splitting. Word splitting uses $IFS, default is space, tab, newline. If an expansion yields spaces, it can produce extra words. \u0026gt; is a redirection operator, not a control operator, so it does not split the command into multiple commands. Redirections are applied after expansions and quote removal, before execution. \u0026gt; creates or overwrites, \u0026gt;\u0026gt; appends. Invisible newline at end of input acts as the terminating control operator for a simple command.

They don’t require explicit declaration type (untyped). Stored as strings by default in bash/sh. Creating Variables name=\u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34; age=20 Note: ⚠️ No spaces around =.\nUsing Variables echo $name echo \u0026#34;I am $age years old\u0026#34; $var → expands value(referencing the value of a variable) ${var} → safer form, avoids ambiguity, and useful for appending file=\u0026#34;report\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;${file}_2025.txt\u0026#34; # report_2025.txt Types of Variables User-defined variables (you create) city=\u0026#34;Multan\u0026#34; Environment variables (system-wide, inherited by child processes) echo $PATH export MYVAR=\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; Best Practices\nUse uppercase for environment vars (PATH, HOME) Use lowercase for local script vars (count, name) Quote variables to avoid word-splitting echo \u0026quot;$path\u0026quot; Read-only Variables readonly pi=3.1415 pi=4 # error Also you can use the declare -r variable_name to make constant.\ndeclare -r age=30 Delete variable and List Variable List All Variables\nset It will display all variables\nDelete a Variable\nunset variable_name Quoting Single Quotes (' ') Everything inside single quotes is taken literally. Variables, command substitution, and escape sequences do not work. You cannot put a literal single quote ' inside single quotes (unless you end and restart quoting or escape cleverly). Example:\necho \u0026#39;Hello $USER\u0026#39; Output:\nHello $USER (Here $USER is not expanded.)\nDouble Quotes (\u0026quot; \u0026quot;) Double quotes are partially literal. Special characters like $, `, and \\ are still interpreted. Variables and command substitution are expanded. Good choice when you want text with spaces but still allow variable substitution. Example:\necho \u0026#34;Hello $USER\u0026#34; Output (suppose user is ahmad):\nHello ahmad Another example with command substitution:\necho \u0026#34;Today is $(date)\u0026#34; Output:\nToday is Mon Sep 09 22:20:15 PKT 2025 Escape Character (\\) Backslash escapes the next character, meaning it loses its special meaning. Useful to print characters like $, \u0026quot;, ', \\, or space. Example:\necho \u0026#34;Hello \\\u0026#34;World\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Output: Hello \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; echo \\$HOME # Output: $HOME # (Instead of expanding it, it prints literally.) Rule of Thumb\nUse single quotes when you want exact literal text. Use double quotes when you want variables and commands to expand. Use backslash for one-off escapes. Environment and Shell Local Variables Local (Shell) Variables Exist only in the current shell session (not inherited by child processes). They disappear when the shell is closed. Default when you create variables with VAR=value without exporting. Example:\nMYVAR=\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; echo $MYVAR # hello bash # open a subshell echo $MYVAR # (nothing printed, variable not passed) exit ✔ Local to the shell, not shared with subshells or programs.\nUser configuration file: ~/.bashrc ~/.zshrc System-wide configuration file: /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile Environment Variables Variables that are exported to child processes. Used by system programs, shells, and user applications. Example: PATH, HOME, USER, LANG. Create/Export an Environment Variable\nexport MYVAR=\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; bash # new subshell echo $MYVAR # hello Save them permanently add them to your .bashrc or .zshrc etc file.\nCommands for Working with Variables set\nLists all variables (local + environment + shell functions). set printenv or env\nShows only environment variables. printenv env export\nMarks a variable as environment. MYVAR=\u0026#34;ahmad\u0026#34; export MYVAR Special Variables (Shell Built-ins) $0 → Script name $1, $2 → Positional parameters (arguments to script) $# → Number of arguments $$ → PID of current shell $? → Exit status of last command $USER, $HOME, $PATH → Common environment variables Key Differences Feature Local Variable Environment Variable Scope Only in current shell In current shell + subshells Created with VAR=value export VAR=value or export VAR Lifetime Ends when shell exits Ends when shell exits (but survives in child shells) Examples MYVAR, counter PATH, HOME, USER, LANG Getting User Input in Shell The read Command Syntax: read [options] variable_name Reads one line of input from the user and stores it into a variable. If no variable is provided, input goes into the built-in variable REPLY. Basic Example:\n#!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;Enter your name:\u0026#34; read NAME echo \u0026#34;Hello $NAME\u0026#34; # Output Enter your name: Ahmad Hello Ahmad Using REPLY (Default Variable) If no variable is given:\necho \u0026#34;Enter something:\u0026#34; read echo \u0026#34;You typed: $REPLY\u0026#34; Prompting Without echo (Using -p) Instead of writing a separate echo, you can directly prompt:\nread -p \u0026#34;Enter your age: \u0026#34; AGE echo \u0026#34;You are $AGE years old\u0026#34; Silent Input (For Passwords) with -s Doesn’t display what the user types.\nread -sp \u0026#34;Enter password: \u0026#34; PASS echo echo \u0026#34;Password saved (hidden)\u0026#34; Multiple Inputs in One Line You can read multiple values at once:\nread -p \u0026#34;Enter first and last name: \u0026#34; FIRST LAST echo \u0026#34;First: $FIRST, Last: $LAST\u0026#34; # Input Ahmad Hassan # Output First: Ahmad, Last: Hassan Useful Options Summary Option Meaning -p Prompt inline -s Silent (hide input) -t N Timeout after N seconds -n N Read N characters only -a Store words into array Rule of Thumb\nUse read -p for interactive scripts. Use read -s for sensitive info. Combine options for flexibility. Positional Parameters What are Positional Parameters? Arguments passed to a script or program from the command line are called positional parameters. They are referenced by numbers ($1, $2, $3, …). Each argument is separated by spaces (default IFS = Internal Field Separator). Example:\n./myscript.sh file.txt dir1 192.168.1.1 $0 → script name (./myscript.sh) $1 → first argument (file.txt) $2 → second argument (dir1) $3 → third argument (192.168.1.1) Accessing Positional Parameters $n gives the nth argument. {} is required for arguments after $9. $9 → ninth argument ${10} → tenth argument ${11} → eleventh argument Default Values for Parameters If a parameter is missing, you can provide a default value with syntax:\n${n:-default_value} Example:\necho \u0026#34;First argument: ${1:-ABC}\u0026#34; If $1 is given → it prints the actual argument. If $1 is missing → it prints \u0026quot;ABC\u0026quot;. 4. $0 Special Parameter $0 → the name of the script as it was invoked. Useful for script self-identification. Example Script: Displaying Positional Parameters #!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;Script name: $0\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;First argument: ${1:-NoArg1}\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Second argument: ${2:-NoArg2}\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Third argument: ${3:-NoArg3}\u0026#34; Run:\n./script.sh A B Output:\nScript name: ./script.sh First argument: A Second argument: B Third argument: NoArg3 Practical Example: Display and Compress Script #!/bin/bash # display_and_compress.sh echo \u0026#34;Displaying the contents of $1\u0026#34; sleep 2 cat \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; echo echo \u0026#34;Compressing $1...\u0026#34; sleep 2 tar -cjvf \u0026#34;$1.tar.gz\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Done! Archive created: $1.tar.gz\u0026#34; What Are Special Parameters? Special parameters are variables provided by the shell that hold important information. You cannot assign values to them, only read them. Common Special Parameters $0 Expands to the name of the shell script being executed. Example: echo \u0026#34;Script name is $0\u0026#34; Output:\nScript name is ./myscript.sh $# Expands to the number of positional parameters (arguments) passed to the script. Example: ./myscript.sh a b c echo \u0026#34;Arguments count: $#\u0026#34; Output:\nArguments count: 3 $@ and $* Both expand to all positional parameters. Subtle difference when quoted: Expression Behavior $@ Expands each argument as a separate word. Useful in loops. $* Expands all arguments as a single word (joined with IFS, default is space). Example:\n./myscript.sh \u0026#34;a b\u0026#34; c for arg in \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34;; do echo \u0026#34;[$arg]\u0026#34;; done # [a b] # [c] for arg in \u0026#34;$*\u0026#34;; do echo \u0026#34;[$arg]\u0026#34;; done # [a b c] $? Expands to the exit status of the most recent command. 0 = success, non-zero = error. Example:\nls /etc echo $? # 0 ls /notexist echo $? # non-zero (error) $$ Expands to the process ID (PID) of the current shell. In a subshell, it still expands to the PID of the invoking shell (not the subshell). Example:\necho \u0026#34;Shell PID is $$\u0026#34; Exit Status Convention ($?) Every command returns a status code: 0 → success Non-zero → error Examples:\nls echo $? # 0 cat /etc/shadow echo $? # Non-zero (permission denied) unknowncommand echo $? # Non-zero (command not found) Quick Summary Table Parameter Meaning $0 Name of the script $# Number of arguments $@ All arguments (each separately, preserves quoting) $* All arguments (as a single word) $? Exit status of last command $$ PID of current shell Rule of Thumb\nUse $0 for script name, $# to check argument count, $@ for iterating arguments, $? to check success/failure, and $$ for PID when scripting background tasks or logs. # $@ vs $* in Shell Scripting Both $@ and $* expand to all positional parameters ($1, $2, $3, …).\nThe key difference appears when they are quoted.\n$@ (All Positional Parameters) Expands to all arguments starting from $1. Unquoted $@ → behaves like $1 $2 $3 …. Quoted \u0026quot;$@\u0026quot; → preserves each argument as a separate quoted string. Equivalent to \u0026quot;$1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;$2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;$3\u0026quot; …. Prevents word splitting inside arguments. Example:\n#!/bin/bash for arg in \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34;; do echo \u0026#34;[$arg]\u0026#34; done Run:\n./script.sh \u0026#34;my file.txt\u0026#34; report.txt doc.pdf Output:\n[my file.txt] [report.txt] [doc.pdf] Note: Each argument remains intact, even with spaces.\n$* (All Positional Parameters) Expands to all arguments as a single string. Unquoted $* → same as unquoted $@ → $1 $2 $3 … (word splitting occurs). Quoted \u0026quot;$*\u0026quot; → treats all parameters as one single string, joined together. The separator used is the first character of IFS (Internal Field Separator). By default, IFS = space, so arguments are joined with spaces.

RMPC is a TUI (terminal UI) client for MPD — it does not do audio output itself, it just sends commands to MPD. (mierak.github.io)\nSo the setup has two parts:\nInstall \u0026amp; configure MPD (the server/daemon that plays music) Install \u0026amp; configure RMPC to connect to MPD Step 1: Install MPD + required clients/tools On Arch-like systems:\nsudo pacman -S mpd mpc You may also install ncmpcpp (another MPD client) for testing. (ArchWiki)\nStep 2: Create necessary directories \u0026amp; base config Create configuration directory and subfolders: mkdir -p ~/.config/mpd/playlists mkdir -p ~/Music Copy the example config (if available) to your user config: On Arch:\ncp /usr/share/doc/mpd/mpdconf.example ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf Or check /usr/share/mpd/mpdconf.example. ([IPv6rs](https://ipv6.rs/tutorial/Arch_Linux/mpd/\u0026quot;How to Install mpd on Arch Linux - IPv6rs\u0026quot;))\nOpen ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf in your editor and set the basic paths. Here is a minimal working example: # Paths (adjust for your username) music_directory \u0026#34;/home/ahmad/Music\u0026#34; playlist_directory \u0026#34;~/.config/mpd/playlists\u0026#34; db_file \u0026#34;~/.config/mpd/database\u0026#34; log_file \u0026#34;~/.config/mpd/log\u0026#34; pid_file \u0026#34;~/.config/mpd/pid\u0026#34; state_file \u0026#34;~/.config/mpd/state\u0026#34; sticker_file \u0026#34;~/.config/mpd/sticker.sql\u0026#34; # Audio output block (choose based on your sound system) audio_output { type \u0026#34;pipewire\u0026#34; name \u0026#34;MPD PipeWire Output\u0026#34; } # Symbolic links behavior follow_outside_symlinks \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; follow_inside_symlinks \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; You can also use type \u0026quot;alsa\u0026quot; or type \u0026quot;pulse\u0026quot; depending on your system. (ArchWiki)\nStep 3: Fix permissions \u0026amp; ensure everything is accessible The MPD process must have read access to your music directory and write access to the config / database files.\nIf you run MPD as your user (not as root), make sure ~/Music and ~/.config/mpd/ are owned by you (or have appropriate permissions).\nEnsure that all parent directories have the “execute” bit (so they can be entered).\nAvoid running MPD as root. Use the user service. (ArchWiki)\nStep 4: Enable \u0026amp; start MPD (with systemd user unit) Because MPD provides a user-level systemd service, you can manage it with:\nsystemctl --user enable mpd systemctl --user start mpd You can also use:\nsystemctl --user restart mpd To check status:\nsystemctl --user status mpd The ArchWiki notes this approach. (ArchWiki)\nAlso note: MPD supports socket activation via mpd.socket. You can enable that instead if you prefer MPD to start on demand. (ArchWiki)\nStep 5: Update MPD’s music database Once MPD is running successfully, you need to tell it to scan your music directory:\nmpc update Or via a UI client (if it supports “update library”).\nCheck that the database is populated:\nmpc ls mpc listall If nothing appears, double-check your music_directory path and permissions.\nStep 6: Install RMPC Follow the instructions in RMPC’s docs: (mierak.github.io)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on Arch:\nsudo pacman -S rmpc Or build via cargo etc.\nStep 7: Configure RMPC(Optional) RMPC needs to know where MPD is (host / port / socket). By default it uses 127.0.0.1:6600. (mierak.github.io)\nYou can create or edit its config file to set:\n# Example in rmpc config address = \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:6600\u0026#34; password = None You may also connect over a UNIX socket if your MPD is configured to use one.\nStep 8: Run RMPC \u0026amp; test control Just run:\nrmpc You should see the TUI, listing songs / playlists etc. You can browse your library, queue songs, play, pause, skip etc.\nIf it fails to connect, check:\nMPD is running\nThe host / port / socket is correct\nNo firewall blocking\nIf MPD requires a password, set it in RMPC config\nTroubleshooting tips \u0026amp; common pitfalls Port already in use: If MPD fails to bind TCP port 6600, maybe another MPD is running or socket activation is handling it. Missing directories or files: Create playlists directory, music folder, etc. Wrong path / username in config: Be careful with your home path. Permissions: The MPD process must have access rights. Audio output misconfigured: If you pick pipewire, pulse, or alsa, ensure your system’s audio pipeline is compatible. Failure on MIDI files: Some decoder plugins (e.g. wildmidi) may complain if dependencies missing — usually ignorable if you don’t use MIDI.

Goal: understand the basics of traditional IT infrastructure to see why cloud computing is valuable. How Websites Work Server: A machine hosted somewhere, storing website files and application code. Client (Web Browser): Requests data from the server. Network: Connects the client to the server, routes data packets back and forth. Process: Client sends request over the network. Server processes the request. Server sends back a response. Client displays the website. Traditional IT Setup Companies used to buy and manage their own physical servers. Requirements included: Hardware (servers, storage, networking gear). Data centers (power, cooling, security, physical space). IT staff (system admins, network engineers). Servers often over-provisioned to handle peak traffic but underutilized most of the time. Scaling required purchasing more servers, which was slow and costly. Challenges of Traditional IT High upfront costs (CAPEX). Long procurement cycles for new hardware. Scalability issues (hard to match demand spikes). Maintenance burden: Hardware failures. Security updates. Network management. Difficult for small/medium businesses to compete with large enterprises. Transition to Cloud Cloud provides on-demand IT resources without upfront investments. Companies rent computing, storage, and networking resources instead of owning hardware. This shift from CAPEX → OPEX (capital expenses → operational expenses) is a key advantage. Takeaway: Cloud computing solves the cost, scalability, and maintenance problems of traditional IT by providing resources on-demand with pay-as-you-go pricing.\nCloud Computing Definition of Cloud Computing Cloud computing = On-demand delivery of: Compute power Database storage Applications Other IT resources Key principle: On-demand (you get it when you need it). Pricing model: Pay-as-you-go (only pay for what you use). Key Features Right size, right time: Choose small, large, or multiple servers instantly. Scale up or down (10 servers today, 2 tomorrow). Instant access: No need to wait hours or days for provisioning. Servers/resources available within seconds. User-friendly interfaces: Web console, APIs, or CLI to manage servers, storage, and apps. Cloud Providers’ Role AWS (and others) own and maintain physical hardware. You provision and use resources via the cloud platform. Example: AWS provides the infrastructure, you just use it through the console/API. Examples of Cloud Services (Everyday Use) Gmail: Cloud email service (pay only for storage used). Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud: Cloud storage services. Netflix: Entirely built on AWS, delivering video-on-demand globally. ✅ Point: You may already use cloud services daily, often without realizing it. Types of Cloud Private Cloud Exclusive to one organization. More control, security, and compliance. Example: Rackspace private cloud. Out of scope for exam, but important concept. Public Cloud Owned and operated by 3rd party providers. Accessible over the internet. Main providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud. Focus of this course. Hybrid Cloud Mix of on-premises infrastructure and public cloud. Keep sensitive workloads locally, extend other workloads to AWS. Combines control + flexibility + cost effectiveness. Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing (important for exam) On-demand self-service: Provision resources without human intervention. Broad network access: Accessible from anywhere via internet. Multi-tenancy \u0026amp; resource pooling: Shared infrastructure, secure isolation for each customer. Rapid elasticity and scalability: Scale up/down automatically based on demand. Measured service: Pay only for what you use, usage is tracked. Six Advantages of Cloud Computing Trade CAPEX for OPEX No upfront hardware purchase. Rent resources, reducing TCO (Total Cost of Ownership). Benefit from economies of scale AWS serves millions of customers. Costs decrease as AWS optimizes and grows. Stop guessing capacity No need to buy servers in advance. Scale automatically with demand. Increased speed and agility Launch resources in minutes. Experiment and innovate faster. Eliminate running data centers No more costs for power, cooling, physical space. Small teams can launch global apps quickly. Go global in minutes Leverage AWS worldwide infrastructure. High availability and fault tolerance built in. Types of Cloud Computing \u0026amp; Pricing Fundamentals Cloud Computing Models There are three main service models to understand:\na) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Provides the building blocks of cloud IT. Includes networking, compute, and storage in raw form. High flexibility, similar to LEGO blocks. Easy to migrate from traditional on-premises IT. Examples: AWS: EC2 Others: Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace b) Platform as a Service (PaaS) Removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure. You focus only on deploying and managing applications. Everything below runtime is managed by provider. Examples: AWS: Elastic Beanstalk Others: Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Services c) Software as a Service (SaaS) Complete product run and managed by the provider. You just use the application, no infrastructure or platform management. Examples: AWS: Rekognition (ML as a service) Others: Gmail, Dropbox, Zoom Comparison with On-Premises On-Premises: You manage everything (apps, data, runtime, OS, hardware, networking). IaaS: You manage apps, data, runtime, OS. Provider manages virtualization, servers, storage, networking. PaaS: You manage only apps and data. Provider manages everything else. SaaS: Provider manages everything. AWS Pricing Fundamentals AWS follows a pay-as-you-go model with 3 key principles:\nCompute → Pay for the exact compute time used. Storage → Pay for the exact amount of data stored. Networking → Pay only when data leaves the cloud. Data into AWS is free. AWS Cloud History of AWS 2002: AWS launched internally at Amazon. Idea: externalize Amazon’s IT infrastructure to help others. 2004: First public service released → Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service). 2006: Relaunch with three core services: SQS (messaging) S3 (Simple Storage Service) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Global Expansion Initially available only in the US. Expanded to Europe, then worldwide. Today AWS has multiple regions and availability zones across the glob Adoption by Companies Many well-known companies run on AWS: Dropbox Netflix Airbnb NASA AWS Scale \u0026amp; Market Position AWS is the largest cloud provider worldwide. Huge growth due to: Wide service portfolio. Global infrastructure. Reliability and scalability. AWS Global Infrastructure AWS Regions AWS Availability Zones AWS Data Centers AWS Edge Locations, Points of Presence How to choose an AWS Region? Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission Proximity to customers: reduced latency Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page AWS Availability Zones Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example: ap-southeast-2a ap-southeast-2b ap-southeast-2c Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking. AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations) AWS Points of Presence (PoPs) are global edge locations hosting services like Amazon CloudFront, Route 53, and Global Accelerator to deliver content with low latency. They are strategically placed in major cities to cache and route data, enhancing performance and availability.\nAmazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations \u0026amp; 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries Content is delivered to end users with lower latency Shared Responsibility Model \u0026amp; Acceptable Use Policy Shared Responsibility Model Defines who is responsible for what in AWS cloud security. Customer’s Responsibility (Security in the Cloud): Data protection and classification. Application security. Operating system patches and updates. Network and firewall configurations. Correct configuration of services. AWS’s Responsibility (Security of the Cloud): Physical infrastructure (hardware, data centers). Global network and storage. Virtualization layer. Their own software and internal security. Acceptable Use Policy When using AWS, you agree not to:\nUse for illegal, harmful, or offensive activities. Perform security violations (hacking, unauthorized access). Abuse networks (e.g., DDoS attacks). Abuse email/messaging (spam, phishing). IAM (Identity and Access Management) What is IAM? IAM = Identity and Access Management. A global service in AWS (not region-specific). Used to manage users, groups, and permissions. Root User Created by default when you make an AWS account. Has full access to everything. Should only be used for initial setup, not daily tasks. Best practice: never share or use root account for normal work.

Developed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2013. It is component-based, declarative, and allows for efficient UI updates. Key Features of React Component-Based Architecture: UI is built using reusable components. Virtual DOM: Updates only the changed parts, making React fast. Unidirectional Data Flow: Props and state maintain a predictable data structure. JSX (JavaScript XML): A syntax extension that lets you write HTML inside JavaScript. Hooks: Allow functional components to have state and other features. Mutable vs Immutable Mutable (Changeable) Mutable data types can be changed after creation. Example: Objects \u0026amp; Arrays are mutable. let arr = [1, 2, 3]; arr.push(4); // Modifies the original array console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4] Immutable (Unchangeable) Immutable data cannot be changed directly. Instead, you create a new copy. Example: Strings \u0026amp; Numbers are immutable. let str = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;; str[0] = \u0026#34;M\u0026#34;; // This won\u0026#39;t change the string console.log(str); // \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; Example of immutable object handling (creating a new object instead of modifying the original):\nconst person = { name: \u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34;, age: 19 }; const updatedPerson = { ...person, age: 20 }; console.log(updatedPerson); // { name: \u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34;, age: 20 } Arrays \u0026amp; Objects Destructuring Array Destructuring Extract values from an array and assign them to variables. const numbers = [10, 20, 30]; const [a, b, c] = numbers; console.log(a, b, c); // 10 20 30 Object Destructuring const person = { name: \u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34;, age: 19, city: \u0026#34;Multan\u0026#34; }; const { name, age } = person; console.log(name, age); // Ahmad 19 Import \u0026amp; Export in JavaScript Exporting in JavaScript Named Export (Multiple Exports) export const name = \u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34;; export const age = 19; export function greet() { return \u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;; } Default Export (Single Export per File) export default function greet() { return \u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;; } Importing in JavaScript Named Import import { name, age, greet } from \u0026#34;./module.js\u0026#34;; console.log(name, age); // Ahmad 19 console.log(greet()); // Hello! Default Import import greet from \u0026#34;./module.js\u0026#34;; console.log(greet()); // Hello! Import Everything import * as data from \u0026#34;./module.js\u0026#34;; console.log(data.name); // Ahmad console.log(data.greet()); // Hello! Concept Description Mutable Can be changed (Objects, Arrays). Immutable Cannot be changed (Strings, Numbers). Primitive Types Stored by value (string, number, boolean, etc.). Reference Types Stored by reference (object, array, function). Destructuring Extracts values from arrays/objects into variables. Import/Export Used to share JavaScript files/modules. Spread (...) Expands arrays/objects into individual values. Rest (...) Gathers multiple values into an array. Map \u0026amp; Filter in JavaScript for React map() Method map() is used to iterate over an array and return a new array with modified elements. It does not modify the original array. Syntax:\nconst newArray = array.map((element, index, array) =\u0026gt; { return modifiedElement; }); Example:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const doubled = numbers.map(num =\u0026gt; num * 2); console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8] filter() Method filter() is used to filter elements based on a condition. It returns a new array with only the elements that satisfy the condition. The original array remains unchanged. Syntax:\nconst newArray = array.filter((element, index, array) =\u0026gt; { return condition; }); Example:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num =\u0026gt; num % 2 === 0); console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4, 6] Method Purpose Returns map() Transforms each element in an array A new array with modified values filter() Selects elements that match a condition A new array with filtered values map() + filter() First filters elements, then transforms them A new modified and filtered array ✅ Use map() to modify each element in an array.\n✅ Use filter() to remove unwanted elements from an array.\n✅ Always use a key prop in React when rendering lists.\nDifference Between Library \u0026amp; Framework Feature Library Framework Definition A collection of reusable code that helps developers perform specific tasks. A full-fledged structure that dictates how the code should be organized. Control You control when and how to use the library. The framework controls the flow of execution. Flexibility More flexible, can be used with other tools. Less flexible, enforces a specific architecture. Example React.js (UI library), Lodash, jQuery Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails Key Difference React (Library): You decide how to structure the app. Angular (Framework): It dictates the structure. Real DOM vs Virtual DOM What is the DOM (Document Object Model)? The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree. JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to update elements dynamically. What is Real DOM? The actual structure of an HTML document in the browser. When a change is made, the entire page re-renders. Slow performance for frequent updates. What is Virtual DOM? A lightweight copy of the Real DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, then compares it with the previous version using diffing. Only the changed parts of the Real DOM get updated, making React much faster. Difference Between Real DOM \u0026amp; Virtual DOM Feature Real DOM Virtual DOM Definition Actual representation of the webpage. Lightweight copy of the Real DOM. Updates Directly updates the UI. Updates in memory first, then syncs with the Real DOM. Performance Slower (entire page re-renders). Faster (only updates changed parts). Efficiency Expensive updates, slow rendering. Optimized updates, fast rendering. Used in Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery. React, Vue.js. Why Virtual DOM is Important in React? ✅ Faster updates compared to Real DOM.\n✅ Better performance for dynamic content.\n✅ Efficient UI rendering with minimal reflows.\nVite vs Create React App (CRA) in React.js 1. Vite 🚀 Modern, fast, and optimized build tool for React. Uses ES modules (ESM) and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates. Super fast startup (no bundling in development). Supports TypeScript, JSX, and more out-of-the-box. Tree-shaking \u0026amp; optimized builds for production. Install React with Vite\nnpm create vite@latest npm install npm run dev 2. Create React App (CRA) 🏗️ Traditional way to set up React projects. Uses Webpack (slower than Vite). Slower builds and HMR compared to Vite. Good for beginners, but outdated for large apps. Install React with CRA\nnpx create-react-app my-app cd my-app npm start JSX (JavaScript XML) \u0026amp; React Vite Folder Structure 1. JSX (JavaScript XML) JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. Looks like HTML inside JavaScript but gets converted to JavaScript functions or React.createElement. Allows embedding JavaScript inside {}. Must return a single parent element (use \u0026lt;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/\u0026gt; if needed). const App = () =\u0026gt; { const name = \u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34;; return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, {name}!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; }; export default App; 2. React Vite Folder Structure . ├── eslint.config.js # ESLint configuration (optional) ├── index.html # Main HTML file (root of the app) ├── node_modules/ # Installed dependencies ├── package.json # Project metadata \u0026amp; dependencies ├── package-lock.json # Exact versions of installed packages ├── public/ # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.) ├── README.md # Project documentation ├── src/ # Main source code directory │ ├── App.jsx # Main React component │ ├── main.jsx # React entry file (renders App) │ ├── assets/ # Images, styles, etc. │ ├── components/ # Reusable UI components │ ├── pages/ # Page components (if using routing) │ └── styles/ # Global CSS files (if needed) └── vite.config.js # Vite configuration file Key Points ✅ src/ contains all React components \u0026amp; logic.\n✅ index.html is the main HTML template.\n✅ Vite uses main.jsx to mount the React app into #root.\n✅ Public files are served as-is from /public/.\nReact Components \u0026amp; How They Work 1. Component in React A component is a reusable, independent UI piece in React. Two types: Functional Components (recommended, use hooks). Class Components (older, uses this.state). Components return JSX and manage their own logic \u0026amp; state. const MyComponent = () =\u0026gt; { return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, React!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; }; export default MyComponent; 2. How They Work ✅ We create components inside the src/components/ folder (e.g., MyComponent.jsx).\n✅ Components are imported into App.jsx, which acts as the main component.\n✅ main.jsx is responsible for rendering App.jsx inside the root \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; in index.html.\n✅ ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')) creates the Virtual DOM and syncs\nFlow of Code in React Create a component (MyComponent.jsx): const MyComponent = () =\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, React!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; export default MyComponent; import it inside App.jsx: import MyComponent from \u0026#34;./components/MyComponent\u0026#34;; const App = () =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MyComponent /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default App; Render App.jsx inside main.jsx: import React from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import ReactDOM from \u0026#34;react-dom/client\u0026#34;; import App from \u0026#34;./App\u0026#34;; ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;)).render(\u0026lt;App /\u0026gt;); index.html contains root div: \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; Key Points ✅ Components are modular \u0026amp; reusable in React.\n✅ main.jsx renders App.jsx inside the root div.\n✅ React Virtual DOM updates only changed parts for better performance. 🚀\nConditional Rendering in React Conditional rendering in React allows components to render dynamically based on conditions.\nUsing if-else Statements\nfunction Greeting(props) { if (props.isLoggedIn) { return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome Back!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; } else { return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Please Sign In\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; } } Using Ternary Operator (? :)\nfunction Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) { return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{isLoggedIn ? \u0026#34;Welcome Back!\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Please Sign In\u0026#34;}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; } Event Handling in React React follows the Synthetic Event system, making event handling efficient across different browsers.\nHandling Click Events\nfunction Button() { function handleClick() { alert(\u0026#34;Button Clicked!\u0026#34;); } return \u0026lt;button onClick={handleClick}\u0026gt;Click Me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;; } Passing Arguments in Event Handlers\nfunction Greeting({ name }) { function sayHello(name) { alert(`Hello, ${name}!`); } return \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; sayHello(name)}\u0026gt;Greet\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;; } Handling Keyboard Events\nfunction InputBox() { function handleKeyPress(event) { if (event.key === \u0026#34;Enter\u0026#34;) { alert(\u0026#34;Enter key pressed!\u0026#34;); } } return \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; onKeyPress={handleKeyPress} /\u0026gt;; } ✅ Conditional Rendering: Use if-else, ternary (? :), \u0026amp;\u0026amp;, or switch-case for rendering components based on conditions.\n✅ Event Handling: Use event handlers like onClick, onKeyPress, onSubmit, etc., with functions.\n✅ Pass Parameters: Use arrow functions for passing arguments in event handlers.\n✅ Prevent Default Behavior: Use event.preventDefault() to stop default browser actions like form submissions.\nState in React State is an object that holds dynamic data that affects a component’s rendering. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be changed within a component. When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updates. Types of State in React Local State: Managed within a single component using useState(). Example: Form inputs, modals, toggles. Global State: Shared across multiple components. Managed using Context API, Redux, or other state management libraries. Server State: Data fetched from an API that needs to be integrated into UI. Managed using tools like React Query, SWR, or Redux Thunk. URL State: State stored in the URL (query parameters, path, etc.). Managed using React Router. Understanding useState() Hook useState() is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It returns an array with two values: The current state value. A function to update the state. Syntax:\nconst [state, setState] = useState(initialValue); Example: Counter App\nimport { useState } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state is 0 return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Count: {count}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; setCount(count + 1)}\u0026gt;Increment\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default Counter; useState(0): Initializes count to 0. setCount(count + 1): Updates the state, causing a re-render. Updating State Correctly 1. Using Functional Updates (Best Practice)\nWhen the new state depends on the previous state, use a function inside setState(). setCount((prevCount) =\u0026gt; prevCount + 1); This ensures correct updates, especially in async operations. 2. Updating Objects in State\nUse spread operator (...) to avoid modifying the original state. const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: \u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34;, age: 19 }); setUser(prevUser =\u0026gt; ({ ...prevUser, age: prevUser.age + 1 })); 3. Updating Arrays in State\nUse spread operator (...) to update arrays. const [items, setItems] = useState([1, 2, 3]); setItems(prevItems =\u0026gt; [...prevItems, 4]); // Adds new item ✅ State is a way to store data inside a component.\n✅ useState() is used to manage local state in functional components.\n✅ Always use the updater function when updating state based on previous values.\n✅ Never modify state directly, always use setState().\nProps (Properties) in React What are Props? Props stand for Properties. Props are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to be dynamic and reusable by passing different data to them. Think of props as function arguments for components. How Props Work Parent component passes props to a child component. Child component receives them as a parameter (usually an object). The child accesses props using props.propName. Syntax 1. Passing Props \u0026lt;ChildComponent name=\u0026#34;Ahmad\u0026#34; age={19} /\u0026gt; 2. Receiving Props function ChildComponent(props) { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Name: {props.name}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Age: {props.age}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } ✅ OR Using Destructuring function ChildComponent({ name, age }) { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Name: {name}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Age: {age}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } 🧩 Key Points Props are immutable: You cannot change props inside the child component. Unidirectional flow: Data flows from parent to child (one-way data binding). Can be any data type: String, number, boolean, array, object, function, etc. Used to customize components and make them reusable. CSS Modules A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class and animation names are scoped locally by default. This means that styles defined in one component won’t affect other components, preventing style conflicts. Used in React.js to maintain modular, reusable, and conflict-free CSS How It Works A CSS file is treated as a module when named with the .module.css extension. Example: MyComponent.module.css In React, you import it as an object where each CSS class becomes a property of that object. 📄 Example File: Button.module.css\n.button { background-color: blue; color: white; } Example Usage in Component import styles from \u0026#39;./Button.module.css\u0026#39;; function Button() { return \u0026lt;button className={styles.button}\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;; } Behind the Scenes CSS Modules use a build tool like Webpack to automatically transform class names into unique identifiers. Example: .button in the source might become .Button_button__3hWkj in the final DOM. The mapping ensures local scoping and uniqueness across components. Comparison with Other Styling Methods Method Scoped Reusable Global Impact Setup Required CSS Modules ✅ ✅ ❌ Minimal Inline Styles ✅ ❌ ❌ None Global CSS ❌ ✅ ✅ None CSS-in-JS (e.g. styled-components) ✅ ✅ ❌ More setup Form Handling in React.js Form handling refers to how input data is captured from HTML forms (like \u0026lt;input\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;textarea\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;select\u0026gt;) and managed using state or references in React.\nKey Concepts: React forms are usually managed through state (controlled) or refs (uncontrolled). You handle form submissions via an onSubmit event handler. You use onChange to capture input updates. Uncontrolled Components \u0026amp; useRef() An uncontrolled component lets the DOM manage the input value, and React accesses it using a ref.\nUsed to directly access a DOM element Doesn’t re-render the component on value change const inputRef = useRef(); const handleSubmit = () =\u0026gt; { console.log(inputRef.current.value); }; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; ref={inputRef} /\u0026gt; Controlled Components A controlled component is an input element whose value is controlled by React state.\nconst [name, setName] = useState(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; value={name} onChange={(e) =\u0026gt; setName(e.target.value)} /\u0026gt; Full Example:\nimport React, { useState } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; function Form() { const [val, setVal] = useState({ name: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, email: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; }); const handleSubmit = (event) =\u0026gt; { event.preventDefault(); console.log(val); }; return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input onChange={(event) =\u0026gt; setVal({ ...val, name: event.target.value })} type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Email\u0026#34; onChange={(event) =\u0026gt; setVal({ ...val, email: event.target.value })} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } export default Form; React Hook Form (Library) React Hook Form is a popular library for building performant and flexible forms in React.\nWhy Use It? Reduces boilerplate code Built-in validation Integrates well with UI libraries like Material UI, Chakra UI, etc. Basic Example:\nimport { useForm } from \u0026#34;react-hook-form\u0026#34;; const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm(); const onSubmit = (data) =\u0026gt; console.log(data); \u0026lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input {...register(\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;)} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; Full Example\nimport React from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import { useForm } from \u0026#34;react-hook-form\u0026#34;; function Form() { const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm(); return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; onSubmit={handleSubmit((data) =\u0026gt; console.log(data))}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input {...register(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;)} type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input {...register(\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;)} type=\u0026#34;age\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;age\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input {...register(\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;)} type=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } export default Form; Dynamic Routing in React.js Dynamic Routing means that the routing is handled at runtime (not at compile time like in traditional HTML websites).\nIn React.js, dynamic routing is implemented using React Router, a library that enables navigation among views of various components.\nUnlike traditional routing where routes are hardcoded in a file (like routes.php), React dynamically loads components based on the current URL.\nInstallation of react-router-dom\nnpm install react-router-dom Core Components of React Router BrowserRouter – Wraps the app and enables routing. Routes – A container for all the Route components. Route – Defines the path and component to render. Link / NavLink – Used for navigation without reloading the page. useParams – Hook to access URL parameters (useful for dynamic routes). Basic Routing Setup import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; import Home from \u0026#39;./Home\u0026#39;; import About from \u0026#39;./About\u0026#39;; function App() { return ( \u0026lt;BrowserRouter\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Routes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;Home /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/about\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;About /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Routes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/BrowserRouter\u0026gt; ); } What is Dynamic Routing? Dynamic routing allows us to create routes where parts of the URL are variables, e.g., /user/1, /user/2, etc.\n\u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/user/:id\u0026#34; element={\u0026lt;UserProfile /\u0026gt;} /\u0026gt; In this case, :id is a route parameter.\nAccessing Dynamic Parameters: useParams useParams() is a React Router hook used to access dynamic parameters from the current URL. It is most useful with dynamic routes like /user/:id, /post/:slug, etc. import { useParams } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; function UserProfile() { const { id } = useParams(); return \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;User ID: {id}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;; } useNavigate() in React Router useNavigate() is a hook provided by react-router-dom. It is used to programmatically navigate to different routes (without clicking a \u0026lt;Link\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;NavLink\u0026gt;). It replaces the older useHistory() from React Router v5. const navigate = useNavigate(); function handleClick() { navigate(\u0026#34;/about\u0026#34;); } 🔁 Navigate with Parameters navigate(`/user/${userId}`); ⏮️ Navigate Back or Forward navigate(-1); // Go back navigate(1); // Go forward Feature Description navigate(\u0026quot;/path\u0026quot;) Navigate to a route navigate(-1) Go back navigate(1) Go forward { replace: true } Replace history entry { state: {...} } Pass data with navigation NavLink in React Router NavLink is a special version of the \u0026lt;Link\u0026gt; component in react-router-dom that adds styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.\nIt’s perfect when you want to highlight the active page in a navigation menu (e.g., changing the color or adding underline).\n\u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/home\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/about\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; Active Styling with NavLink By default, NavLink applies an active class when the route matches.\nYou can also provide your own styles or class names based on the active state using:\n✅ className as a Function\n\u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/home\u0026#34; className={({ isActive }) =\u0026gt; isActive ? \u0026#34;active-link\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;inactive-link\u0026#34;} \u0026gt; Home \u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; ✅ style as a Function\n\u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/about\u0026#34; style={({ isActive }) =\u0026gt; ({ color: isActive ? \u0026#34;green\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;gray\u0026#34;, textDecoration: isActive ? \u0026#34;underline\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;none\u0026#34; })} \u0026gt; About \u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; Example with Full NavBar import { NavLink } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; import \u0026#34;./styles.css\u0026#34;; // Assume you have .active-link class here function Navbar() { return ( \u0026lt;nav\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34; end className={({ isActive }) =\u0026gt; isActive ? \u0026#34;active-link\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\u0026gt; Home \u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/about\u0026#34; className={({ isActive }) =\u0026gt; isActive ? \u0026#34;active-link\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\u0026gt; About \u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NavLink to=\u0026#34;/contact\u0026#34; className={({ isActive }) =\u0026gt; isActive ? \u0026#34;active-link\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;\u0026#34;}\u0026gt; Contact \u0026lt;/NavLink\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; ); } Summary of NavLink Prop/Feature Description to=\u0026quot;/path\u0026quot; Target route className Function that gives conditional class style Function that returns conditional style end Ensures exact matching isActive Boolean indicating current URL match \u0026lt;Outlet /\u0026gt; in React Router \u0026lt;Outlet /\u0026gt; is a placeholder component used to render child routes inside a parent route. It\u0026rsquo;s like saying: “Here is where the nested component will appear.” ✅ How It Works Visiting /dashboard/profile will render: Dashboard component Profile component inside the \u0026lt;Outlet /\u0026gt; Visiting /dashboard/settings will render: Dashboard component Settings component inside the \u0026lt;Outlet /\u0026gt; import { Outlet } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; function Dashboard() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Dashboard Layout\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {/* Nested route component will be rendered here */} \u0026lt;Outlet /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } API Integration in React.js using AJAX (fetch / axios) API integration in React lets your app communicate with backends, external services, or databases. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used to make asynchronous requests to APIs.\n1. Using fetch useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { fetch(\u0026#39;https://api.example.com/data\u0026#39;) .then(res =\u0026gt; res.json()) .then(data =\u0026gt; setData(data)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err)); }, []); fetch() returns a Promise. Must manually handle JSON parsing (res.json()). 2. Using axios npm install axios // install this package to use axios import axios from \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;; import React from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; const App = () =\u0026gt; { const api = \u0026#34;https://fakestoreapi.com/products\u0026#34;; // 📥 Function to GET products from the API const getProducts = () =\u0026gt; { axios .get(api) .then((res) =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;GET:\u0026#34;, res)) .catch((err) =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;GET Error:\u0026#34;, err)); }; // 📤 Function to POST (add) a new product to the API const addProducts = () =\u0026gt; { axios .post(api, { id: 0, title: \u0026#34;Sample Product\u0026#34;, price: 0.1, description: \u0026#34;This is a test product.\u0026#34;, category: \u0026#34;sample-category\u0026#34;, image: \u0026#34;http://example.com/image.jpg\u0026#34;, }) .then((res) =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;POST:\u0026#34;, res)) .catch((err) =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;POST Error:\u0026#34;, err)); }; return ( \u0026lt;div className=\u0026#34;p-5\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {/* 🟢 Button to trigger GET request */} \u0026lt;button onClick={getProducts} className=\u0026#34;px-3 py-2 m-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-lg text-white\u0026#34; \u0026gt; Get Data \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; {/* 🔵 Button to trigger POST request */} \u0026lt;button onClick={addProducts} className=\u0026#34;px-3 py-2 m-2 bg-green-600 rounded-lg text-white\u0026#34; \u0026gt; Send Data \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default App; Example (with async/await) useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { const fetchData = async () =\u0026gt; { try { const response = await axios.get(\u0026#39;https://api.example.com/data\u0026#39;); setData(response.data); } catch (err) { console.error(err); } finally { setLoading(false); } }; fetchData(); }, []); React Component Lifecycle The component lifecycle refers to the sequence of methods/functions that are invoked during the life of a React component — from its creation to its removal from the DOM.\n🧱 3 Main Phases: 1. Mounting Component is being created and inserted into the DOM.\nconstructor() → (Class component only) render() componentDidMount() ✅ (ideal for API calls, subscriptions) 2. Updating When props or state change.\nshouldComponentUpdate() → (optional) render() componentDidUpdate() ✅ (runs after update) 3. Unmounting Component is removed from the DOM.\ncomponentWillUnmount() ✅ (cleanup tasks: timers, subscriptions, etc.) Functional Components use useEffect for all of this! A React Hook for handling side effects (e.g. API calls, DOM updates, subscriptions). Runs after the component renders. Basic Syntax useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { // effect logic return () =\u0026gt; { // optional cleanup }; }, [dependencies]); Dependency Array []: runs once after initial render (like componentDidMount) [var]: runs when var changes No array: runs after every render Note: When we [] square bracket in useEffect() component only update the changed part and if we don\u0026rsquo;t add square bracket component re-render means first it deleted and then again created.\n💡 Common Uses API calls Event listeners Timers Cleanups (return function) Full Example useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;About Component is Created\u0026#34;); return () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;About Comonent is Deleted\u0026#34;); }; Example: Cleanup (like componentWillUnmount) useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { const timer = setInterval(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Running interval...\u0026#34;); }, 1000); return () =\u0026gt; { clearInterval(timer); // 🧹 cleanup console.log(\u0026#34;Interval cleared\u0026#34;); }; }, []); What is React Reconciliation React Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently when the state or props of a component change.\nThis makes updates fast and efficient, instead of redrawing the whole UI.\nNote: 🔍 Think of reconciliation as React saying: \u0026ldquo;Okay, what exactly changed? Let me only update that part.\u0026rdquo;\nTerm What it Means Triggered By Happens In Updating When React detects a change in props or state. setState, parent re-render, context change, etc. Component lifecycle Re-rendering When the component’s render method runs again (or JSX is re-evaluated in function components). After an update (or forced render) Virtual DOM const [val, setVal] = useState(\u0026#34;This is Normal Data\u0026#34;); const [val2, setVal2] = useState(\u0026#34;This is Very Large Data\u0026#34;); useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;About Component is Created\u0026#34;); return () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;About Comonent is Deleted\u0026#34;); }; }, [val2]); // component only re-render when val2 is changed otherwise it update only changed part. Axios for Session Management \u0026amp; Separation 1. Why Use a Separate Axios File? Centralizes config (base URL, headers, interceptors) Cleaner code, reusable instance Easy to maintain sessions (cookies, tokens) Can add error handlers globally 2. Basic Axios Setup (Separate File) 🗂️ File: axiosInstance.js\nimport axios from \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;; // Create an Axios instance const instance = axios.create({ baseURL: \u0026#34;https://fakestoreapi.com/\u0026#34;, // 🏠 Your backend URL withCredentials: true, // ✅ Important for session cookies }); export default instance; 3. What withCredentials: true Does Allows Axios to send cookies and authentication headers Required when working with sessions (esp. JWT or Express sessions) Must also be enabled on backend (CORS settings) 4. Using It in Components import axios from \u0026#34;../axiosInstance\u0026#34;; const getProducts = async () =\u0026gt; { try { const res = await axios.get(\u0026#34;/products\u0026#34;); console.log(res.data); } catch (err) { console.error(err); } }; Concept Purpose withCredentials Send cookies for session management axios.create() Reusable config for base URL, etc. interceptors Add headers (like auth) automatically instance.get() Use anywhere like normal Axios ReactJS Context API A way to share data between components without passing props manually at every level. Solves prop drilling (passing data from parent to child repeatedly). When to Use Context API? When you need to share state across many components (e.g., theme, user authentication, language, etc.) Good for global state management in small to medium-sized apps. Key Components of Context API React.createContext() Creates a context object. const MyContext = React.createContext(); \u0026lt;Context.Provider\u0026gt; Wraps components to provide the context value. \u0026lt;MyContext.Provider value={someData}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ChildComponent /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/MyContext.Provider\u0026gt; useContext(Context) A hook to access the context value in a functional component. const value = useContext(MyContext); Example: Basic Usage // 1. Create Context const ThemeContext = React.createContext(); // 2. Create a Provider Component const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) =\u0026gt; { const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState(\u0026#34;light\u0026#34;); return ( \u0026lt;ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}\u0026gt; {children} \u0026lt;/ThemeContext.Provider\u0026gt; ); }; // 3. Use Context in a Child Component const ThemeToggler = () =\u0026gt; { const { theme, setTheme } = React.useContext(ThemeContext); return ( \u0026lt;button onClick={() =\u0026gt; setTheme(theme === \u0026#34;light\u0026#34; ? \u0026#34;dark\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;light\u0026#34;)}\u0026gt; Switch to {theme === \u0026#34;light\u0026#34; ? \u0026#34;dark\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;light\u0026#34;} mode \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; ); }; // 4. Wrap in App const App = () =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;ThemeProvider\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ThemeToggler /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ThemeProvider\u0026gt; ); Redux Toolkit (RTK) What is Redux Redux is a state management library used with JavaScript apps (especially React) to manage and share application-wide state in a predictable way.\nWhat is React-Redux? React-Redux is the official binding library that allows React components to interact with the Redux store using hooks like:\nuseSelector() – read state useDispatch() – send actions It acts as a bridge between Redux and React.\nWhy Redux Toolkit is Useful ✅ Reduces boilerplate code (less code, same result) ✅ Built-in support for async actions using createAsyncThunk ✅ Uses Immer.js internally so you can write mutable-style logic safely ✅ Easy and clean setup via configureStore and createSlice ✅ Encourages best practices by default Core Concepts Concept Description Store Holds the global state Slice A piece of the store: includes state + reducers Action An object describing a change Reducer A function that updates state based on action Dispatch A way to send actions to the store Selector Reads state from the store Redux Toolkit vs Context API Feature Redux Toolkit Context API 🧠 Purpose Complex state management Simple state sharing 🔁 Re-renders Optimized with useSelector() Causes re-renders of all consumers 🔌 DevTools Built-in support for Redux DevTools ❌ No DevTools 🧵 Async Logic Built-in with createAsyncThunk Needs custom setup 📦 Scalability Highly scalable (slices, modular code) Not ideal for large apps 🔧 Boilerplate Minimal with RTK Less than raw Redux, but Context still has limitations 🔒 Predictability More structured and strict More flexible but can lead to mess Use Context API: For theme, language, auth user – simple state Use Redux Toolkit: For complex state logic, shared global data, multiple components, async logic Redux Flow Diagram: 📦 Store – Global State Container The store is where all the application state lives. It combines different reducers (e.g., user, products, carts) into one centralized global state. The store is created using configureStore() in Redux Toolkit. 🧩 Reducers – Handle State Changes Reducers are functions that decide how the state should change in response to actions. Each reducer manages its own slice of state (e.g., user state, products state, carts state). Redux Toolkit allows you to define reducers inside createSlice(). 🎯 Action – Event Trigger An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened. Actions are sent from components using dispatch() and are automatically created via createSlice() in RTK. For example:\n{ type: \u0026quot;cart/addToCart\u0026quot;, payload: { id: 1, name: \u0026quot;Product A\u0026quot; } } 🧵 From App.jsx (Any Component) Any component (like App.jsx or its children) can: Read data using useSelector() – it\u0026rsquo;s read-only, not mutable. Send actions using useDispatch() to update the global state. Installation and Usage 1. Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux Add the Redux Toolkit and React-Redux packages to your project:\nnpm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux 2. Create a Redux Store Create a file named src/app/store.js. Import the configureStore API from Redux Toolkit. We\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it:\nimport { configureStore } from \u0026#39;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#39; export const store = configureStore({ reducer: {}, }) 3. Provide the Redux Store to React Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux \u0026lt;Provider\u0026gt; around our application in src/index.js. Import the Redux store we just created, put a \u0026lt;Provider\u0026gt; around your \u0026lt;App\u0026gt;, and pass the store as a prop:\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById(\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;)).render( \u0026lt;Provider store={store}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;App /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Provider\u0026gt; ); Note: Redux installed and below is example usage\n4. Create a Redux State Slice import { createSlice } from \u0026#39;@reduxjs/toolkit\u0026#39; const initialState = { value: 0, } export const counterSlice = createSlice({ name: \u0026#39;counter\u0026#39;, initialState, reducers: { increment: (state) =\u0026gt; { // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \u0026#34;mutating\u0026#34; logic in reducers. It // doesn\u0026#39;t actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library, // which detects changes to a \u0026#34;draft state\u0026#34; and produces a brand new // immutable state based off those changes state.value += 1 }, decrement: (state) =\u0026gt; { state.value -= 1 }, incrementByAmount: (state, action) =\u0026gt; { state.value += action.payload }, }, }) // Action creators are generated for each case reducer function export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions export default counterSlice.reducer 5.

That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? The 80/20 Principle shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent t at really counts. Although the 80/20 principle has long influenced today\u0026rsquo;s business world, author Richard Koch reveals how the principl works and shows how we can use it in a systematic and practical way to vastly increase our effectiveness, and improve our careers and o r companies.\nThe unspoken corollary to the 80/20 principle is that little of what we spend our time on actually counts. But by concentrating on those things that do, we can unlock the enormous potential of the magic 20 percent, and transform our effectiveness in our jobs, our careers, our businesses, and our lives.\n1) 80/20: The Basics The 80/20 Principle:\n80% of your effort, action, or input will lead to only 20% of your results, output, rewards, or victories. 20% of your efforts, action, or input is what leads to the majority of your results, output, rewards and victories. It is a proven nonlinear approach to everything that happens. You will see this consistently across the board 20% of the pea pods will have 80% of the peas 80% of the money in this world is controlled by 20% of the people 80% of your carpet wear will be on 20% of your carpet 80% of your profits come from 20% of your customers 2) You Can Be great The 80/20 principle states that it is possible for anyone to achieve greatness.\nThe key: Do not spend your time trying to figure out how much effort you will need to become great at something.\nInstead: Figure out what is the right thing for you to do.\njWhat is it that makes you great? What is it that makes you come alive? What is that area where you are the best? If you\u0026rsquo;re spending your time on everything else, you\u0026rsquo;re just going to be wasting your life away, never getting to that point of greatness.\nSo find that area where you can be great and just push on that. Continue to work on that.\nThat may be where you\u0026rsquo;re expending minimum effort but are getting the most benefit from. That is the area where you will get exponential results.\n3) Choose Your Allies One of the most important decisions you can make in your life concerns your allies \u0026ndash; figuring out who are the people you are going to spend time with.\nBut in most cases, people are doing this wrong.\nThe allies they have are by default. They just happened to run into certain kinds of people and hence they associated with them. That how they choose \u0026ndash; or how they don’t choose \u0026ndash; their allies.\nThese are the wrong kinds of “allies.” Your allies should not be chosen by default People have too many allies. There are just too many people in their lives who do not add much value.\nPeople do not know how to use their allies, how to be able to leverage them.\nThe key to 80/20 thinking Say this: “I\u0026rsquo;m going to choose my allies who are going to help me move forward in my life.”\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not going to do it by default. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be by design.\nPick a few allies that are powerful. Pick a few that are going to really help you move the needle forward. Don’t have too many. And then use them properly. Leverage their strengths and they will leverage yours. That\u0026rsquo;s the power of allies. You help each other out and you build each other up and get exponential results in the process.\n4) Design Your Own Game How people play the game of life\nThey play their game of life by default They play the game of life that their parents want them to play, that the society wants them to play They continue to lose at that game because they never designed the game that they are in. But as 80/20 thinkers, we need to design our game \u0026ndash; the game that we most want to play \u0026ndash; then it will be really easy for us to win at that game.\nThose with default conditioning are actually playing someone else\u0026rsquo;s game. They\u0026rsquo;re simply wasting their time playing others’ games, society’s games, and so on \u0026ndash; anything but their own game, which is what really matters.\nThe greatest innovations and the greatest accomplishments are always a result of people who are designing their own game and hence winning at those games. They\u0026rsquo;re designing their own races of life and are playing in those races, winning in those races, and that\u0026rsquo;s what we need to do.\nWe need to design our own game and win in those games to get exponential results.\n5) Achievement Island / Desert As you look back at your life, what you\u0026rsquo;ll see is That\nthere are short periods of time when you get extreme results there are long periods of time when you got almost no results Wonder what’s going on?\nThe key to harnessing the power of 80/20:\nRealize that we\u0026rsquo;re gonna have these short periods of extreme results (or the author’s so-called “Achievement Islands”)\nTo Do:\nMake a list of all the times in your life where you\u0026rsquo;ve had these Achievement Islands. Be guided by these questions: Where have you had extreme results in very short durations of time? What are the key characteristics of those situations? What are the things that stand out when you think about these moments of extreme results? What happened? Why did you get those results? On the other end, make a list of the times in your life where you almost got no results at all despite trying and trying (“Achievement Deserts”). What happened? What were the common situations or characteristics that were happening during those long periods of time? Now your job is to focus as much as possible on the things where you were getting maximum results. Those are what will get you to move towards your Achievement Islands rather than your Achievement Deserts. 6) 80/20 in Relationships When it comes to relationships, 80/20 principle still holds true.\n80% of your relationships give you only 20% value 20% of your relationships give you 80% value So what you need to do is ensure that you\u0026rsquo;re spending 80% of your relationship time on only 20% of those relationships. These are your high-leverage people, the relationships that are creating the most value.\nWith that, spend only 20% on the remaining 80% people in your life.\nMany people tend to spray their effort with a lot of different relationships (the 80%) all over the place.\nThese are relationships that don\u0026rsquo;t bring them any long-term value. They have a lot of friends, but none of them are real. None of them are actually going to help them build anything useful or accomplish great goals. As an 80/20 practitioner, find a few powerful alliances. These are your key allies ( your 20%).\nDevelop deep relationships with them. Spend a lot of quality time with them in order to strengthen those 20% relationships. Richard Koch says that all we need is just 6-7 key allies, and then we can do tremendously in our lives. We don\u0026rsquo;t need 100, 200, or 500 friends. From there we can leverage the power of our relationships.\nStart figuring out who these people are, or those who will add that value to your life. Design your circle rather than let it happen b default, which happens unfortunately to most people.\n7) Ruthlessly Prune We need to cut down. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to add. We need to remove, to reduce, so that we can get massive results. This process is called ruthless pruning.\nThe problem that happens with most people:\n80% of their time is encroaching on their 20% time where they create the most value. 80% of their allies are encroaching on the 20% that create the most value for them. 80% of your customers actually take up so much value that you end up not having enough value to give to the 20% customers who create the most value for you. Mental energy expended on 80% of your projects is taking away mental energy from. the 20% projects that create the most value/exponential results for you. Actions expended on 80% of your projects do the same thing. They take away from the 20% projects that are creating the most leverage, the most value for you. The same happens with any area of business - marketing efforts, sales effort, strategic efforts, whatever it is.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why one of the things Jack Welch at G.E said was: “We\u0026rsquo;re only going to do things that we can be in the Top 2 to Top 3 in the world. If we\u0026rsquo;re not in the Top 2 or Top 3, then we\u0026rsquo;re going to stop doing those things.”\nHence, we\u0026rsquo;re going to only expend our energy on the 20% things and we\u0026rsquo;re going to ruthlessly prune the 80%, even if there is some result coming from it\u0026hellip; in order to exponentially grow the areas of business and life where we\u0026rsquo;re getting maximum results.\n8) Multiply Output In order to multiply our output, we need to move our resources from an unproductive place to a productive place, from an unproductive arena into an arena, where the resource can be productive.\nEXAMPLE: A hammer is great at hammering a nail but it\u0026rsquo;s not useful when it comes to cutting a piece of cloth. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to help.\nSimilarly, a pair of scissors is great at cutting a piece of cloth but entirely useless when it comes to hammering a nail.\nBoth these resources are very powerful but they have to be used in the right arena and that\u0026rsquo;s the key.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the 80/20 \u0026ndash; the understanding that the resource needs to be used in the right arena where you get 10x, 100x, even 1000x more improvement or higher productivity.\nThe same holds with you. If you\u0026rsquo;re using your resources and your strengths properly, then you are living in the right arena. You are being highly productive.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re not using those strengths properly, if you are using them in the wrong arena, you are in the unproductive zone.\nAgain, our job is to move our resources from an unproductive area to a productive area. That’s when we can massively multiply our productivity.\nKEY POINTS: The basics - The 80/20 principle in a nutshell. You can be great - How the 80/20 principle can make you, and everyone else, great. Choosing allies - Why choosing your allies is important and how to identify them. Design your own game - Stop living your life by default. Achievement island and desert - Be clear with your “achievement islands” and only build on them. Relationships - How the 80/20 principle applies to our relationships and how we can improve them. Ruthlessly prune - Why we need to reduce, not add, in our lives. Multiplying output - Use your strengths and resources properly in order to multiply your productivity.

We’ll use AssistantUI, a modern framework to create conversational experiences using powerful LLMs.\nStep 1: Install the Prerequisites Before we begin, make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:\nInstall Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Install Node.js (Node.js). Install Git (Git). Step 2: Set Up the Project Directory Create a folder named chatbot:\nmkdir chatbot \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd chatbot Open the folder in VS\ncode . Step 3: Scaffold the Assistant UI App npx assistant-ui@latest create This command will prompt you to select a template. Choose the chat template. This will create a new folder named assistant-ui with the necessary files and dependencies.\nStep 4: Set Up Dependencies Move into the generated project folder (likely chatbot):\ncd chatbot Install the required SDKs:\nnpm install ai @assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk @ai-sdk/google Step 5: Integrate Google Gemini API Open the file:\n/app/api/chat/route.ts Clear all content in the file and paste the following code:\nimport { google } from \u0026#34;@ai-sdk/google\u0026#34;; import { streamText } from \u0026#34;ai\u0026#34;; export const maxDuration = 30; export async function POST(req: Request) { const { messages } = await req.json(); const result = streamText({ model: google(\u0026#34;gemini-2.0-flash\u0026#34;), messages, }); return result.toDataStreamResponse(); } Get your Google Gemini API Key from the Google AI Studio.\nStep 6: Store Your API Key Create a new environment file in the root directory:\n.env.local Add the following line:\nGOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=\u0026#34;Your_API_KEY\u0026#34; Make sure to replace Your_API_KEY with your actual API key.\nStep 7: Run the Development Server Start your app locally:\nnpm run dev Your application will be live at:\nhttp://localhost:3000 Step 8: Build for Production Build your app for production:\nnpm run build This command will create a .vercel folder in your project directory.\nClean up: Delete the node_modules folder and .env.local file before uploading to GitHub for security reasons.\nStep 9: Upload your code to GitHub Create a new repository on GitHub. Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder: git init Add your files to the repository: git add . Commit your changes: git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; Add the remote repository: git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/chatbot.git Push your changes: git push -u origin main Step 10: Deploy to vercel Go to Vercel and sign in with your GitHub account. Click on the \u0026ldquo;New Project\u0026rdquo; button. Select your GitHub repository. Vercel will automatically detect the framework and set up the build settings. When prompted, add your API key as an environment variable:\nGOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY = your_key_here Step 11: Your AI Chatbot is Live! Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a live URL for your chatbot. You can share this URL with anyone to access your AI chatbot.\nFinal Notes Make sure to keep your API key secure and do not expose it in your public repositories.

It stores data in tables, rows, and columns, allowing efficient retrieval and manipulation. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. DBMS DBMS(Database Management System) is software used to create, manage, and organize databases.\nA DBMS is software that manages and controls database operations like storing, retrieving, and updating data. It ensures data consistency, security, and integrity while providing an interface for users to interact with the database. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 🚀 What is RDBMS RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - is a DBMS based on the concept of tables (also called relations). Data is organized into tables(also known as relations) with rows(records) and columns(attributes). E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server etc. SQL SQL is Structured Query Language - used to store, manipulate and retrieve data from RDBMS.\nWe use SQL for CRUD Operations:\nCREATE - To Create databases, tables, insert tuples etc. READ - To read data present int the database. UPDATE - Modify already insert data. DELETE - Delete database, table or specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows. NOTE : SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive. E.g., select is the same as SELECT in SQL.\nCreate Database We can use the the following command to create the database.\nCREATE DATABASE database_name; Delete Database We Can use the DROP command to delete the database.\nDROP DATABASE database_name; Select/Use the Database We can use the USE command to select db and perform operation.\nUSE db_name; SQL vs MySQL SQL is a language used to perform CRUD operations in Relational DB, while MySQL is a RDBMS that uses SQL.\nCreating Table We can create the table in db using the CREATE TABLE command whole syntax is given below.\nCREATE TABLE table_name( column_name1 datatype constraint; column_name2 datatype constraint; column_name3 datatype constraint; ); SQL Data Types In SQL, data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column or variable.\nDatatype Description Usage CHAR String (0-255), can store characters of fixed length CHAR(50) VARCHAR String (0-255), can store characters up to given length VARCHAR(50) BLOB String (0-65535), can store binary large object BLOB(1000) INT Integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) INT TINYINT Integer (-128 to 127) TINYINT BIGINT Integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) BIGINT BIT Can store x-bit values. x can range from 1 to 64 BIT(2) FLOAT Decimal number - with precision to 23 digits FLOAT DOUBLE Decimal number - with 24 to 53 digits DOUBLE BOOLEAN Boolean values 0 or 1 BOOLEAN DATE Date in format of YYYY-MM-DD ranging from 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31 DATE TIME HH:MM:SS TIME YEAR Year in 4-digit format ranging from 1901 to 2155 YEAR Note - CHAR is for fixed length \u0026amp; VARCHAR is for variable length strings. Generally, VARCHAR is better as it only occupies necessary memory \u0026amp; works more efficiently.\nSigned \u0026amp; Unsigned : We can also use UNSIGNED with datatypes when we only have positive values to add. Eg - UNSIGNED INT\nTINYINT UNSIGNED (0 to 255)\nTINYINT (-128 to 127)\nTypes of SQL Commands DDL(Database Definition Language): Used to create, alter, delete database objects like tables, indexes, etc. (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE). DQL(Database Query Language): Used to retrieve data from databases. (SELECT). DML(Database Manipulation Language): Used to modify the database. (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). DCL(Database Control Language): Used to grant \u0026amp; revoke permissions. (GRANT, REVOKE). TCL(Transaction Control Language): Used to manage transactions, (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, START TRANSACTIONS, SAVEPOINT). DATABASE related Queries CREATE DATABASE db_name; -- used to create database CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name; -- create database if database not exist of this name. DROP DATABASE db_name; -- delete database DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name; -- delete database if exists SHOW DATABASES; -- show all databases SHOW TABLES; -- used to show all tables in particular database Table related Queries Create Tables We can use the following syntax to create the table or design the scheme of table.\nCREATE TABLE table_name( column_name1 datatype constraint; column_name2 datatype constraint; ); Example\nCREATE TABLE student( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), age INT NOT NULL ); Select \u0026amp; View ALL columns SELECT * FROM table_name; -- display whole table Insert INSERT INTO table_name (colname1, colname2); VALUES (col1_v1, col2_v1), (col1_v2, col2_v2); Keys Primary Key It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id). There is only 1 Primary Key and it should not be NOT null\nForeign Key A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. There can be multiple FKs. FKs can be have duplicate \u0026amp; null values.\nSecondary Key Secondary key may or may not be unique field. Some times records are required to access by a field other than the primary key. In these situations another key that is used is called secondary key.\nComposite Key Composite key consists of two or more than two fields. Composite key is also designed as a primary key. It is created in a situation when no single field fulfills the property of uniqueness. To make unique more than one field are combined and used as primary key.\nConstraints SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.\nNOT NULL : columns cannot have null value. col1 INT NOT NULL UNIQUE : all values in column are different. col2 UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY : makes a column unique \u0026amp; not null but used only for one. id INT PRIMARY KEY. also declare as PRIMARY KEY (id). Foreign Key Prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.\nCREATE TABLE temp( cust_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) references customer(id) ); DEFAULT sets the default value of a column\nsalary INT DEFAULT default_value; CHECK It can limit the values allowed in a column.\nCREATE TABLE city( id INT PRIMARY KEY, city VARCHAR(50), age INT, CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age\u0026gt;= 16 AND city=\u0026#34;Delhi\u0026#34;) ); CREATE TABLE newTab ( age INT CHECK (age\u0026gt;=18) ); Select in Detail SELECT The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.\nSELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name; To Select All SELECT * FROM table_name; Tip: DISTINCT Keyword Removes duplicate rows from query results.\nSyntax:\nSELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table_name; Where Clause To define some conditions\nSELECT col1,col2 from table WHERE condition(s). SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks \u0026gt; 80; SELECT * FROM student WHERE city=\u0026#34;Multan\u0026#34;; Operator in WHERE Arithmetic Operators : + , - , * , / , % Comparison Operators : = , != , \u0026gt; , \u0026gt;= , \u0026lt; , \u0026lt;= Logical Operators : AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY Bitwise Operators : \u0026amp; , | Operators AND (to check for both conditions to be true) SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks \u0026gt; 80 AND city=\u0026#34;Multan\u0026#34;; OR (to check for one of the conditions to be true) SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks \u0026gt; 90 OR city=\u0026#34;Lahore\u0026#34;; BETWEEN : select for a given range SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90; IN : (matches any value in the list) SELECT * FROM student WHERE city IN (\u0026#34;Multan\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Karachi\u0026#34;) NOT : (to negate the given condition) SELECT * FROM student WHERE city NOT IN (\u0026#34;Multan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Karachi\u0026#34;) Limit Clause The limit clause is used to sets an upper limit on number of(tuples)rows to be returned.\nSELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3; SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name LIMIT number; Order by Clause To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.\nSELECT * FROM student ORDER BY city ASC; SELECT col1,col2 FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name(s) ASC; Aggregate Functions Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.\nCOUNT() MAX() MIN() SUM() AVG() Get Maximum Marks\nSELECT MAX(marks) FROM student; Get Average marks\nSELECT AVG(marks) FROM student; Group By Clause Group rows that have the same values into summary rows. It collect data from multiple records(rows) and groups the result by one ore more column.\nGenerally we use the group by with some aggregation function.\nCount number of students in each city\nSELECT city, count(name) FROM student GROUP BY city; HAVING Clause Similar to WHERE i.e., applies some condition on rows. Used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.\nCount number of students in each city where max marks cross 90.\nSELECT city, count(rollno) FROM student GROUP BY city HAVING MAX(marks) \u0026gt; 90; General Order SELECT column(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column(s) ASC;\nExample:\nSELECT city FROM student WHERE grade = \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; GROUP BY city HAVING MAX(marks) \u0026gt; 90 ORDER BY city DESC; Table related Queries UPDATE is used to update existing rows in a table.\nUPDATE table_name SET col1=val1, col2=val2 WHERE condition; UPDATE student SET grade = \u0026#34;O\u0026#34; WHERE grade = \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;; DELETE is used to delete the existing rows in a table\nDELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; DELETE FROM student WHERE marks \u0026lt; 33; Foreign Key A foreign key (FK) is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables. It refers to the primary key (PK) in another table, ensuring data integrity and enforcing referential constraints.\nCREATE TABLE Orders ( order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) ); Cascading for FK On Delete Cascade When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key.\nOn Update Cascade When we create a foreign key using UPDATE CASCADE the referencing rows are updated in the child table when the referenced row is updated in the parent table which has a primary key.\nCREATE TABLE teacher( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), dept_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) references dept(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE ); Alter The ALTER is used to change the schema of table in a database.\nADD Column ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraint; DROP Column ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name; RENAME Column ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name; CHANGE Column(rename) ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name new_datatype new_constraint; MODIFY Column(modify datatype/ constraint) ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY col_name new_datatype new_constraint; Truncate The TRUNCATE is used to delete the data of table in database.\nTRUNCATE TABLE table_name ; Joins in SQL JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.\n1. Inner Join Returns records that have matching values in both tables Syntax\nSELECT column(s) FROM tableA INNER JOIN tableB ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name; Example\nSELECT * FROM student INNER JOIN course ON student.student_id = course.student_id; Tip: SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. An alias is created with the AS keyword.\nSELECT CustomerID AS ID FROM Customers; 2. Left Join Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. Syntax\nSELECT columns(s) FROM talbeA LEFT JOIN tableB ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name; Example\nSELECT * FROM student as s LEFT JOIN course as c ON s.student_id = c.student_id; 3. Right Join Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table\nSyntax\nSELECT column(s) FROM tableA RIGHT JOIN tableB ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name; Example\nSELECT * FROM student as s RIGHT JOIN course as c ON s.student_id = c.student_id; 4. Full Join Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table\nSELECT * FROM student AS s LEFT JOIN course AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id UNION SELECT * FROM student AS s LEFT JOIN course AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id; Left Exclusive Join Exclusive joins in SQL are used to retrieve records that exist in one table but not in the other when performing a LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN.\nA Left Exclusive Join retrieves records from the left table that do not have matching records in the right table.\nSELECT * FROM student AS a LEFT JOIN course AS b ON a.id = b.id WHERE b.id IS NULL; Right Exclusive Join A Right Exclusive Join retrieves records from the right table that do not have matching records in the left table.\nSELECT * FROM student AS a RIGHT JOIN course AS b ON a.id = b.id WHERE a.id IS NULL; Self Join It is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.\nSELECT column(s) FROM table as a JOIN table as b ON a.col_name = b.col_name Union It is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. Gives UNIQUE records.\nevery SELECT should have same no. of columns columns must have similar data types columns in every SELECT should be in same order SELECT column(s) FROM tableA UNION SELECT column(s) FROM tableB and we can also use the UNION ALL to give all the values including the duplicates records.\nSQL Sub Queries A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query. It is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition.\nIt involves 2 select statements.\nSyntax SELECT column(s) FROM table_name WHERE col_name operator ( subquery ); Example with FROM SELECT MAX(marks) FROM (SELECT marks FROM student WHERE city = \u0026#39;Delhi\u0026#39;) AS temp; MySQL Views A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.\nA view always shows up-to-date data. The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.\nCREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT rollno, name, marks FROM student; Stored Procedures in MySQL A Stored Procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed repeatedly. It helps encapsulate logic in a modular way, improving reusability, maintainability, and performance.\nBenefits of Stored Procedures Modularity – Write once, use many times. Performance – Precompiled for faster execution. Security – Users can be granted access to run procedures without giving access to underlying tables. Reduced network traffic – Fewer queries sent between application and server. Syntax: Creating a Stored Procedure DELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name ( IN param1 datatype, OUT param2 datatype, INOUT param3 datatype ) BEGIN -- SQL statements go here END // DELIMITER ; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID(IN emp_id INT) BEGIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id; END // DELIMITER ; Calling a Stored Procedure CALL GetEmployeeByID(1); If there are OUT or INOUT parameters:\nCALL ProcedureName(@out_param); SELECT @out_param; Types of Parameters Type Description IN Input only (passed by value). OUT Output only (value returned). INOUT Both input and output (passed by reference). Modifying or Dropping Stored Procedures DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS procedure_name; Alter is not supported: You must drop and recreate the procedure. Control Structures in Stored Procedures IF-ELSE Used to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.\nIF condition THEN -- statements ELSE -- statements END IF; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE CheckAge(IN age INT) BEGIN IF age \u0026gt;= 18 THEN SELECT \u0026#39;You are an adult\u0026#39; AS result; ELSE SELECT \u0026#39;You are a minor\u0026#39; AS result; END IF; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL CheckAge(20); -- Output: You are an adult CALL CheckAge(15); -- Output: You are a minor CASE Statement Used as an alternative to multiple IF statements when checking several conditions.\nSyntax:\nCASE variable WHEN value1 THEN statement1; WHEN value2 THEN statement2; ELSE statement_default; END CASE; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE GradeResult(IN grade CHAR(1)) BEGIN CASE grade WHEN \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; THEN SELECT \u0026#39;Excellent\u0026#39; AS Result; WHEN \u0026#39;B\u0026#39; THEN SELECT \u0026#39;Good\u0026#39; AS Result; WHEN \u0026#39;C\u0026#39; THEN SELECT \u0026#39;Average\u0026#39; AS Result; ELSE SELECT \u0026#39;Fail or Invalid Grade\u0026#39; AS Result; END CASE; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL GradeResult(\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;); -- Output: Excellent CALL GradeResult(\u0026#39;D\u0026#39;); -- Output: Fail or Invalid Grade WHILE Loop Repeats a block of statements while the condition is true.\nSyntax\nWHILE condition DO -- statements END WHILE; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE CountToFive() BEGIN DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1; WHILE i \u0026lt;= 5 DO SELECT CONCAT(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39;, i) AS Output; SET i = i + 1; END WHILE; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL CountToFive(); ## REPEAT Loop Similar to WHILE, but checks the condition after executing the block.\nSyntax:\nREPEAT -- statements UNTIL condition END REPEAT; Example:\nDELIMITER // CREATE PROCEDURE RepeatExample() BEGIN DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1; REPEAT SELECT CONCAT(\u0026#39;Repeat Count: \u0026#39;, i) AS Output; SET i = i + 1; UNTIL i \u0026gt; 5 END REPEAT; END // DELIMITER ; -- Call the procedure CALL RepeatExample(); Error Handling Use DECLARE ...

Timeline for Sequencing Animations GSAP’s gsap.timeline() helps chain animations in sequence.\nlet tl = gsap.timeline(); tl.to(\u0026#34;.box\u0026#34;, { x: 100, duration: 1 }) .to(\u0026#34;.box\u0026#34;, { y: 100, duration: 1 }) .to(\u0026#34;.box\u0026#34;, { rotation: 360, duration: 1 }); 6. Easing Functions Easing makes animations feel natural.\ngsap.to(\u0026#34;.box\u0026#34;, { x: 300, duration: 2, ease: \u0026#34;bounce.out\u0026#34; }); gsap.to(\u0026#34;.circle\u0026#34;, { y: -100, duration: 1, ease: \u0026#34;elastic.out(1, 0.3)\u0026#34; }); 7. Staggering Animations Use stagger to animate multiple elements with delay.\ngsap.to(\u0026#34;.boxes\u0026#34;, { y: 100, duration: 1, stagger: 0.2 }); 8. ScrollTrigger (GSAP Plugin) To trigger animations on scroll:\nCDN\n\u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/ScrollTrigger.min.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Example:\ngsap.to(\u0026#34;.box\u0026#34;, { // Animates the element with class \u0026#34;box\u0026#34; x: 300, // Moves the element 300 pixels to the right duration: 2, // Animation lasts for 2 seconds scrollTrigger: { // Uses the ScrollTrigger plugin to trigger animation on scroll trigger: \u0026#34;.box\u0026#34;, // The animation starts when the \u0026#34;.box\u0026#34; element enters the viewport scroller: \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;, // Specifies the scrolling container (default is \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;) markers: true, // Displays visual markers (start and end points) for debugging start: \u0026#34;top 80%\u0026#34;, // Animation starts when the top of \u0026#34;.box\u0026#34; reaches 80% of the viewport height end: \u0026#34;top 30%\u0026#34;, // Animation ends when the top of \u0026#34;.box\u0026#34; reaches 30% of the viewport height scrub: true, // Makes the animation progress smoothly with scrolling } }); Explanation of ScrollTrigger Properties Property Description trigger Defines which element should trigger the animation when it enters/exits the viewport. scroller Specifies the scrollable container (default is body). Useful when working with scrollable divs. markers Adds visual markers to indicate where the animation starts and ends (for debugging). start Defines when the animation starts. \u0026quot;top 80%\u0026quot; means when the top of .box reaches 80% of the viewport height. end Defines when the animation ends. \u0026quot;top 30%\u0026quot; means when the top of .box reaches 30% of the viewport height. scrub Syncs the animation with the scroll position. If true, the animation plays forward and backward as the user scrolls. Delays the animation by 1 second, creating a smoother transition. if scrub is scrub: 2 it has range 1-5. pin The pin: true property locks (pins) an element in place while the user scrolls past it. Locomotive Locomotive Scroll is a powerful JavaScript library that provides smooth scrolling, parallax effects, and scroll-based animations. It enhances user experience by making scrolling feel more natural.\n1.

This includes selecting, modifying, adding, or removing elements from the webpage.\nSelecting Elements in the DOM Before modifying elements, we need to select them. Here are the different ways:\nMethod Description Example document.getElementById(id) Selects an element by its ID document.getElementById(\u0026quot;myDiv\u0026quot;) document.getElementsByClassName(className) Selects elements by class name (returns an HTMLCollection) document.getElementsByClassName(\u0026quot;myClass\u0026quot;) document.getElementsByTagName(tagName) Selects elements by tag name (returns an HTMLCollection) document.getElementsByTagName(\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;) document.querySelector(selector) Selects the first element that matches the CSS selector document.querySelector(\u0026quot;.myClass\u0026quot;) document.querySelectorAll(selector) Selects all elements that match the CSS selector (returns a NodeList) document.querySelectorAll(\u0026quot;div\u0026quot;) Examples of Selection Methods 1. Selecting an Element by ID let title = document.getElementById(\u0026#34;main-title\u0026#34;); console.log(title.innerText); // Logs the text inside the element 2. Selecting Elements by Class Name let items = document.getElementsByClassName(\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;); console.log(items[0].innerText); // Logs the first element\u0026#39;s text 3. Selecting Elements by Tag Name let paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;); console.log(paragraphs.length); // Logs the number of \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; elements 4. Selecting an Element Using querySelector() Returns only the first matching element.\nlet firstItem = document.querySelector(\u0026#34;.item\u0026#34;); // Selects the first `.item` console.log(firstItem.innerText); 5. Selecting Multiple Elements Using querySelectorAll() Returns a NodeList, supports .forEach().\nlet allItems = document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#34;.item\u0026#34;); // Selects all `.item` allItems.forEach((item) =\u0026gt; console.log(item.innerText)); innerHTML vs innerText vs textContent in JavaScript 1. innerHTML ✅ Gets or sets the HTML content (including tags) inside an element.\n✅ Parses and renders HTML if assigned.\n❌ Can expose security risks (XSS attacks) if inserting user input.\nlet h1 = document.querySelector(\u0026#34;h1\u0026#34;); h1.innerHTML += \u0026#34; \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;hello\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026#34;; 2. innerText ✅ Gets or sets only the visible text inside an element.\n✅ Ignores hidden elements (like display: none;).\n❌ Does not retain HTML tags.\nlet h1 = document.querySelector(\u0026#34;h1\u0026#34;); h1.innerText += \u0026#34;Hack the Planat\u0026#34;; 3. textContent ✅ Gets or sets all text (including hidden text) inside an element.\n✅ Preserves whitespace and hidden elements (e.g., display: none;).\n❌ Does not interpret HTML tags.\nlet h1 = document.querySelector(\u0026#34;h1\u0026#34;); h1.textContent += \u0026#34; Hack the Planat\u0026#34;; Key Differences Between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent Property HTML Support Includes Hidden Text?

// Logs the newly created \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Appending Elements – appendChild() ✅ Inserts a new child element inside a parent. ✅ Moves elements if they already exist (won\u0026rsquo;t duplicate them).\nconst parent = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;container\u0026#39;); // Select an existing parent element parent.appendChild(newDiv); // Adds the new div inside the parent element insertBefore() – Insert Before a Specific Element Inserts a new element before an existing child element.\nconst firstChild = parent.firstElementChild; // Get the first child of the parent parent.insertBefore(newDiv, firstChild); // Insert newDiv before the first child Removing Elements – removeChild() ✅ Deletes a child element from its parent.\n❌ If the element does not exist inside the parent, it throws an error.\nparent.removeChild(firstChild); // Removes the first child from the parent Removing an Element Directly (remove()) Instead of removeChild(), you can use element.remove() (modern method).\nnewDiv.remove(); // Removes the newly created \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;

That’s fine.\nBut quite often we find that we need an ordered collection, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on. For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, goods, HTML elements etc.\nIt is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can’t insert a new property “between” the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.\nThere exists a special data structure named Array, to store ordered collections.\nDeclaration There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:\nlet arr = new Array(); let arr = []; Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plum\u0026#34;]; Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.\nWe can get an element by its number in square brackets:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plum\u0026#34;]; alert( fruits[0] ); // Apple alert( fruits[1] ); // Orange alert( fruits[2] ); // Plum We can replace an element:\nfruits[2] = \u0026#39;Pear\u0026#39;; // now [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34;] …Or add a new one to the array:\nfruits[3] = \u0026#39;Lemon\u0026#39;; // now [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Lemon\u0026#34;] The total count of the elements in the array is its length:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plum\u0026#34;]; alert( fruits.length ); // 3 We can also use alert to show the whole array.\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plum\u0026#34;]; alert( fruits ); // Apple,Orange,Plum An array can store elements of any type.\nFor instance:\n// mix of values let arr = [ \u0026#39;Apple\u0026#39;, { name: \u0026#39;John\u0026#39; }, true, function() { alert(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); } ]; // get the object at index 1 and then show its name alert( arr[1].name ); // John // get the function at index 3 and run it arr[3](); // hello Get last elements with “at” Let’s say we want the last element of the array.\nSome programming languages allow the use of negative indexes for the same purpose, like fruits[-1].\nAlthough, in JavaScript it won’t work. The result will be undefined, because the index in square brackets is treated literally.\nWe can explicitly calculate the last element index and then access it: fruits[fruits.length - 1].\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plum\u0026#34;]; alert( fruits[fruits.length-1] ); // Plum A bit cumbersome, isn’t it? We need to write the variable name twice.\nLuckily, there’s a shorter syntax: fruits.at(-1):\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Plum\u0026#34;]; // same as fruits[fruits.length-1] alert( fruits.at(-1) ); // Plum In other words, arr.at(i):\nis exactly the same as arr[i], if i \u0026gt;= 0. for negative values of i, it steps back from the end of the array. Methods pop/push, shift/unshift A queue is one of the most common uses of an array. In computer science, this means an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:\npush appends an element to the end. shift get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so that the 2nd element becomes the 1st. Arrays support both operations.\nIn practice we need it very often. For example, a queue of messages that need to be shown on-screen.\nThere’s another use case for arrays – the data structure named stack.\nIt supports two operations:\npush adds an element to the end. pop takes an element from the end. So new elements are added or taken always from the “end”.\nA stack is usually illustrated as a pack of cards: new cards are added to the top or taken from the top:\nFor stacks, the latest pushed item is received first, that’s also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. For queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).\nArrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. They allow you to add/remove elements, both to/from the beginning or the end.\nIn computer science, the data structure that allows this, is called deque.\nMethods that work with the end of the array:\npop\nExtracts the last element of the array and returns it:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34;]; alert( fruits.pop() ); // remove \u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34; and alert it alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange Both fruits.pop() and fruits.at(-1) return the last element of the array, but fruits.pop() also modifies the array by removing it.\npush\nAppend the element to the end of the array:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;]; fruits.push(\u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34;); alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear The call fruits.push(...) is equal to fruits[fruits.length] = ....\nMethods that work with the beginning of the array:\nshift\nExtracts the first element of the array and returns it:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34;]; alert( fruits.shift() ); // remove Apple and alert it alert( fruits ); // Orange, Pear unshift\nAdd the element to the beginning of the array:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Pear\u0026#34;]; fruits.unshift(\u0026#39;Apple\u0026#39;); alert( fruits ); // Apple, Orange, Pear Methods push and unshift can add multiple elements at once:\nlet fruits = [\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;]; fruits.push(\u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Peach\u0026#34;); fruits.unshift(\u0026#34;Pineapple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Lemon\u0026#34;); // [\u0026#34;Pineapple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Lemon\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Peach\u0026#34;] alert( fruits ); Objects As we know from the chapter Data types, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).\nIn contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.\nAn object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.\nWe can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.\nAn empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:\nlet user = new Object(); // \u0026#34;object constructor\u0026#34; syntax let user = {}; // \u0026#34;object literal\u0026#34; syntax Usually, the figure brackets {...} are used. That declaration is called an object literal.\nLiterals and properties We can immediately put some properties into {...} as “key: value” pairs:\nlet user = { // an object name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, // by key \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; store value \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; age: 30 // by key \u0026#34;age\u0026#34; store value 30 }; A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon \u0026quot;:\u0026quot; and a value to the right of it.\nIn the user object, there are two properties:\nThe first property has the name \u0026quot;name\u0026quot; and the value \u0026quot;John\u0026quot;. The second one has the name \u0026quot;age\u0026quot; and the value 30. The resulting user object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled “name” and “age”.\nWe can add, remove and read files from it at any time.\nProperty values are accessible using the dot notation:\n// get property values of the object: alert( user.name ); // John alert( user.age ); // 30 The value can be of any type. Let’s add a boolean one:\nuser.isAdmin = true To remove a property, we can use the delete operator:\ndelete user.age; We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30, \u0026#34;likes birds\u0026#34;: true // multiword property name must be quoted }; The last property in the list may end with a comma:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30, } That is called a “trailing” or “hanging” comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike.\nSquare brackets For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work:\n// this would give a syntax error user.likes birds = true JavaScript doesn’t understand that. It thinks that we address user.likes, and then gives a syntax error when comes across unexpected birds.\nThe dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters ($ and _ are allowed).\nThere’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:\nlet user = {}; // set user[\u0026#34;likes birds\u0026#34;] = true; // get alert(user[\u0026#34;likes birds\u0026#34;]); // true // delete delete user[\u0026#34;likes birds\u0026#34;]; Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).\nSquare brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression – as opposed to a literal string – like from a variable as follows:\nlet key = \u0026#34;likes birds\u0026#34;; // same as user[\u0026#34;likes birds\u0026#34;] = true; user[key] = true; Here, the variable key may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.\nFor instance:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30 }; let key = prompt(\u0026#34;What do you want to know about the user?\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;); // access by variable alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30 }; let key = \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;; alert( user.key ) // undefined Computed properties We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called computed properties.\nFor instance:\nlet fruit = prompt(\u0026#34;Which fruit to buy?\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;); let bag = { [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit }; alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit=\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34; The meaning of a computed property is simple: [fruit] means that the property name should be taken from fruit.\nSo, if a visitor enters \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, bag will become {apple: 5}.\nEssentially, that works the same as:\nlet fruit = prompt(\u0026#34;Which fruit to buy?\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;); let bag = {}; // take property name from the fruit variable bag[fruit] = 5; …But looks nicer.\nWe can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:\nlet fruit = \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;; let bag = { [fruit + \u0026#39;Computers\u0026#39;]: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5 }; Square brackets are much more powerful than dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.\nSo most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.\nProperty value shorthand In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names.\nFor instance:\nfunction makeUser(name, age) { return { name: name, age: age, // ...other properties }; } let user = makeUser(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, 30); alert(user.name); // John variable is so common, that there’s a special property value shorthand to make it shorter.\nInstead of name:name we can just write name, like this:\nfunction makeUser(name, age) { return { name, // same as name: name age, // same as age: age // ... }; } We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:\nlet user = { name, // same as name:name age: 30 }; Property names limitations As we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of the language-reserved words like “for”, “let”, “return” etc.\nBut for an object property, there’s no such restriction:\n// these properties are all right let obj = { for: 1, let: 2, return: 3 }; alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return ); // 6 In short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).\nOther types are automatically converted to strings.\nFor instance, a number 0 becomes a string \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; when used as a property key:\nlet obj = { 0: \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; // same as \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; }; // both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;) alert( obj[\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;] ); // test alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property) Property existence test, “in” operator A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it’s possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn’t exist!\nReading a non-existing property just returns undefined. So we can easily test whether the property exists:\nlet user = {}; alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means \u0026#34;no such property\u0026#34; There’s also a special operator \u0026quot;in\u0026quot; for that.\nThe syntax is:\n\u0026#34;key\u0026#34; in object For instance:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30 }; alert( \u0026#34;age\u0026#34; in user ); // true, user.age exists alert( \u0026#34;blabla\u0026#34; in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn\u0026#39;t exist Please note that on the left side of in there must be a property name. That’s usually a quoted string.\nIf we omit quotes, that means a variable should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:\nlet user = { age: 30 }; let key = \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;; alert( key in user ); // true, property \u0026#34;age\u0026#34; exists Why does the in operator exist? Isn’t it enough to compare against undefined?\nWell, most of the time the comparison with undefined works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but \u0026quot;in\u0026quot; works correctly.\nIt’s when an object property exists, but stores undefined:\nlet obj = { test: undefined }; alert( obj.test ); // it\u0026#39;s undefined, so - no such property? alert( \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; in obj ); // true, the property does exist! In the code above, the property obj.test technically exists. So the in operator works right.\nSituations like this happen very rarely, because undefined should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use null for “unknown” or “empty” values. So the in operator is an exotic guest in the code.\nThe \u0026ldquo;for..in\u0026rdquo; loop To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: for..in. This is a completely different thing from the for(;;) construct that we studied before.\nThe syntax:\nfor (key in object) { // executes the body for each key among object properties } For instance, let’s output all properties of user:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30, isAdmin: true }; for (let key in user) { // keys alert( key ); // name, age, isAdmin // values for the keys alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true } Note that all “for” constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like let key here.\nAlso, we could use another variable name here instead of key. For instance, \u0026quot;for (let prop in obj)\u0026quot; is also widely used.\nObject methods, \u0026ldquo;this\u0026rdquo; “this” in methods It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.\nFor instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.\nTo access the object, a method can use the this keyword.\nThe value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.\nFor instance:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30, sayHi() { // \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; is the \u0026#34;current object\u0026#34; alert(this.name); } }; user.sayHi(); // John Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.\nTechnically, it’s also possible to access the object without this, by referencing it via the outer variable:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 30, sayHi() { alert(user.name); // \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; instead of \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; } }; “this” is not bound In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.\nThere’s no syntax error in the following example:\nfunction sayHi() { alert( this.name ); } The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.\nFor instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different “this” in the calls:\nlet user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; }; let admin = { name: \u0026#34;Admin\u0026#34; }; function sayHi() { alert( this.name ); } // use the same function in two objects user.f = sayHi; admin.f = sayHi; // these calls have different this // \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; inside the function is the object \u0026#34;before the dot\u0026#34; user.f(); // John (this == user) admin.f(); // Admin (this == admin) admin[\u0026#39;f\u0026#39;](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn\u0026#39;t matter) Arrow functions have no “this” Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.\nFor instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method:\nlet user = { firstName: \u0026#34;Ilya\u0026#34;, sayHi() { let arrow = () =\u0026gt; alert(this.firstName); arrow(); } }; user.sayHi(); // Ilya That’s a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate this, but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited we’ll go more deeply into arrow functions.\nSummary Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”. Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething(). Methods can reference the object as this. The value of this is defined at run-time.\nWhen a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called. A function can be copied between objects. When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object. Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.\nKey Points In Global Scope the value of this is window. In function the value of this is window In Method the value of this is object function inside the method es5(deceleration function) the value of this is window. function inside the method es6(expression function) the value of this is object. the value of this in constructor function is blank object. In event listener value of this will be according to the element. call/apply/bind call There’s a special built-in function method func.call(context, …args) that allows to call a function explicitly setting this.\nThe syntax is:\nfunc.call(context, arg1, arg2, ...) It runs func providing the first argument as this, and the next as the arguments.\nTo put it simply, these two calls do almost the same:\nfunc(1, 2, 3); func.call(obj, 1, 2, 3) They both call func with arguments 1, 2 and 3. The only difference is that func.call also sets this to obj.\nAs an example, in the code below we call sayHi in the context of different objects: sayHi.call(user) runs sayHi providing this=user, and the next line sets this=admin:\nfunction sayHi() { alert(this.name); } let user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; }; let admin = { name: \u0026#34;Admin\u0026#34; }; // use call to pass different objects as \u0026#34;this\u0026#34; sayHi.call( user ); // John sayHi.call( admin ); // Admin apply Instead of func.call(this, ...arguments) we could use func.apply(this, arguments).\nThe syntax of built-in method func.apply is:\nfunc.apply(context, args) It runs the func setting this=context and using an array-like object args as the list of arguments.\nThe only syntax difference between call and apply is that call expects a list of arguments, while apply takes an array-like object with them.\nSo these two calls are almost equivalent:\nfunc.call(context, ...args); func.apply(context, args); Example:\nfunction func(a, b, c) { console.log(this, a, b, c); } func.call(obj, [1, 2, 3]); bind() The bind() method of Function instances creates a new function that, when called, calls this function with its this keyword set to the provided value, and a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.\nIt does not call function. It just return another function that we can store in variable to call it\nfunction func() { console.log(this); } let n = func.bind(\u0026#34;ahmad\u0026#34;); n(); Prototypal inheritance In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property [[Prototype]] (as named in the specification), that is either null or references another object. That object is called “a prototype”:\nWhen we read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, this is called “prototypal inheritance”. And soon we’ll study many examples of such inheritance, as well as cooler language features built upon it.\nThe property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.\nPrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Instead of using classes like in classical inheritance (as in Java or C++), JavaScript uses prototypes.\nfunction makeHuman(name,age){ this.name = name; this.age = age; } makeHuman.prototype.greet = 12; makeHuman.prototype.func = function(){ console.log(this.name); } let human1 = new makeHuman(\u0026#34;ahmad\u0026#34;,20); let human2 = new makeHuman(\u0026#34;ali\u0026#34;,30); How It Works: Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which points to another object.\nWhen you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself.\nIf the property/method is not found, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it either finds the property or reaches null.\nThe value of “this” An interesting question may arise in the example above: what’s the value of this inside set fullName(value)? Where are the properties this.name and this.surname written: into user or admin?\nThe answer is simple: this is not affected by prototypes at all.\nNo matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, this is always the object before the dot.\nSo, the setter call admin.fullName= uses admin as this, not user.\nThat is actually a super-important thing, because we may have a big object with many methods, and have objects that inherit from it. And when the inheriting objects run the inherited methods, they will modify only their own states, not the state of the big object.\nClosures in JS A closure in JavaScript is a function that remembers the variables from its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.\nHow It Works: When a function is created inside another function, it captures the outer function’s variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.\nfunction counter() { let count = 0; return function() { count++; console.log(count); }; } const increment = counter(); increment(); // 1 increment(); // 2 What is an Event Listener in JavaScript? An event listener is a method that allows you to wait for a specific event (like a click, keypress, hover, etc.) and run a function when the event occurs.\n✅ Example of addEventListener() document.getElementById(\u0026#34;btn\u0026#34;).addEventListener(\u0026#34;click\u0026#34;, function() { console.log(\u0026#34;Button Clicked!\u0026#34;); }); Here, addEventListener(\u0026quot;click\u0026quot;, function) listens for a click event on the button with id=\u0026quot;btn\u0026quot;. When clicked, it logs \u0026quot;Button Clicked!\u0026quot;. Common Events Event Description click When an element is clicked mouseover When the mouse hovers over an element keydown When a key is pressed submit When a form is submitted What is querySelector in JavaScript? querySelector() is a method used to select an element from the DOM using CSS selectors.\nExample of querySelector() const heading = document.querySelector(\u0026#34;h1\u0026#34;); // Selects the first `\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;` element heading.style.color = \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;; // Changes its color to red Selecting Elements document.querySelector(\u0026#34;#myId\u0026#34;); // Selects an element by ID document.querySelector(\u0026#34;.myClass\u0026#34;); // Selects the first element with this class document.querySelector(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;); // Selects the first \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; element Event Delegation in JavaScript Event Delegation is a pattern that allows you to handle events efficiently by attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding multiple listeners to child elements.\n🤔 Why Use Event Delegation? ✅ Better Performance → Avoids adding multiple event listeners.\n✅ Handles Dynamic Elements → Works even for elements added later via JavaScript.\n✅ Less Memory Usage → Reduces the number of event listeners.\nExample\nlet parent = document.querySelector(\u0026#34;#parent\u0026#34;); parent.addEventListener(\u0026#34;click\u0026#34;, function (ev) { if (ev.target.id === \u0026#34;play\u0026#34;) { console.log(\u0026#34;Play Song\u0026#34;); } else if (ev.target.id === \u0026#34;pause\u0026#34;) { console.log(\u0026#34;Pause Song\u0026#34;); } }); When Should You Use Event Delegation? Handling clicks on lists, tables, menus, or dynamically added elements. Handling form inputs when adding fields dynamically. Improving performance for elements inside large containers. Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript A Higher-Order Function (HOF) is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.\nfunction func1(f1) { // func1 takes a function as an argument (HOF property) f1(); // Calls the passed function return function () { // Returns a new function (HOF property) console.log(\u0026#34;returned fun\u0026#34;); }; } fun = function () { console.log(\u0026#34;Passed Function\u0026#34;); }; let returned = func1(fun); // Call func1 with \u0026#39;fun\u0026#39; function returned(); // Call the returned function Built-in Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript Method Description map() Transforms an array by applying a function to each element. filter() Filters an array based on a condition. reduce() Reduces an array to a single value. forEach() Iterates over an array but does not return a new one. Handling Errors with `try\u0026hellip;catch The try...catch block allows you to handle errors gracefully. The try...catch statement is used to handle errors, and throw is used to create custom errors.\nBasic Example of try...catch\ntry { let x = y + 5; // ❌ ReferenceError: y is not defined } catch (error) { console.log(\u0026#34;An error occurred:\u0026#34;, error.message); } 🔹 If an error occurs inside try, execution moves to catch, preventing a crash.\nUsing throw to Create Custom Error function divide(a, b) { if (b === 0) { throw new Error(\u0026#34;Cannot divide by zero!\u0026#34;); // 🚀 Custom error } return a / b; } try { console.log(divide(10, 0)); // ❌ Throws an error } catch (error) { console.log(\u0026#34;Error:\u0026#34;, error.message); } 🔹 throw allows custom error messages instead of generic JavaScript errors.\nfinally Block (Always Executes) try { console.log(\u0026#34;Trying something...\u0026#34;); throw new Error(\u0026#34;Something went wrong!\u0026#34;); } catch (error) { console.log(\u0026#34;Caught Error:\u0026#34;, error.message); } finally { console.log(\u0026#34;This runs no matter what!\u0026#34;); } Custom Events in JavaScript A Custom Event in JavaScript is an event that you manually create and dispatch using the CustomEvent constructor. This allows communication between different parts of your application.\nCreating and Dispatching a Custom Event The CustomEvent constructor takes two arguments: 1️⃣ Event Name (string)\n2️⃣ Event Options (optional, includes detail for extra data)\nlet ev = new Event(\u0026#34;newEv\u0026#34;); document.querySelector(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;).addEventListener(\u0026#34;newEv\u0026#34;, function () { console.log(\u0026#34;Custom Event\u0026#34;); }); document.querySelector(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;).dispatchEvent(ev); Full Example: Custom Event with Data\n// Create and dispatch custom event const customEvent = new CustomEvent(\u0026#34;userLoggedIn\u0026#34;, { detail: { username: \u0026#34;ahmad9059\u0026#34;, role: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; } }); document.addEventListener(\u0026#34;userLoggedIn\u0026#34;, function (event) { console.log(`User: ${event.detail.username}, Role: ${event.detail.role}`); }); // Dispatch the event document.dispatchEvent(customEvent); When to Use Custom Events?\nFor component communication (e.g., sending data between different UI components). When working with user interactions that don\u0026rsquo;t have built-in events. For event-driven architectures where actions trigger custom behavior.

However, JavaScript provides mechanisms to handle tasks asynchronously, allowing it to perform operations without blocking the main execution thread.\n1. Synchronous JavaScript In synchronous execution, tasks run one after another, meaning JavaScript waits for one operation to complete before moving to the next. This can cause delays if a task takes a long time (e.g., reading a large file or making a network request).\nExample:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Start\u0026#34;); function syncFunction() { console.log(\u0026#34;Processing...\u0026#34;); } syncFunction(); console.log(\u0026#34;End\u0026#34;); Here, JavaScript executes statements one by one in order, blocking execution until each task is completed.\n2. Asynchronous JavaScript Asynchronous JavaScript allows tasks to run in the background without blocking the execution of other tasks. This is useful for operations like fetching data from an API, reading files, or handling timers.\nDoes NOT wait for one task to complete before moving to the next. Allows JavaScript to handle time-consuming operations (API calls, file reads, etc.) efficiently. Uses the Event Loop to manage async tasks. How Asynchronous JavaScript Works JavaScript uses the Event Loop and the Call Stack to handle asynchronous code efficiently. It uses:\nCallbacks(setTimeout,setInterval) Fetch API Axios Promises Async/Await Callbacks A callback function is passed as an argument to be executed later.given example use the both setTimeout and setInterval and clearInterval to stop the setInterval\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Start of program\u0026#34;); // setTimeout: Delays execution by 3 seconds setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;setTimeout: This runs after 3 seconds\u0026#34;); }, 3000); // setInterval: Runs every 2 seconds let counter = 0; let intervalID = setInterval(() =\u0026gt; { counter++; console.log(`setInterval: Counter is ${counter}`); // Stop interval after 5 executions if (counter === 5) { clearInterval(intervalID); console.log(\u0026#34;clearInterval: Stopped interval after 5 executions\u0026#34;); } }, 2000); console.log(\u0026#34;End of program (before timeouts and intervals execute)\u0026#34;); Fetch API The fetch() API is asynchronous because it makes network requests without blocking the execution of other code. It returns a Promise, which resolves when the request completes.\nfetch(\u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\u0026#34;) // Fetch data from API .then((response) =\u0026gt; response.json()) // Convert response to JSON .then((data) =\u0026gt; console.log(data)) // Log the data .catch((error) =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;Error fetching data:\u0026#34;, error)); 🔹 How it works? 1️⃣ fetch() makes an HTTP request (returns a Promise).\n2️⃣ .json() parses the response into JavaScript object (also async, returns a Promise).\n3️⃣ .then() handles the resolved data.\n4️⃣ .catch() handles errors (e.g., network failure).\nAxios Axios is asynchronous because it makes network requests without blocking execution. It is built on top of JavaScript Promises, similar to fetch(), but with more features.\nWhy use Axios?\nNo need to manually parse JSON (Axios does it automatically). Better error handling (Fetch only rejects on network errors, while Axios rejects on HTTP errors too). More readable with async/await. axios.get(\u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\u0026#34;) .then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(response.data)) // Axios auto-parses JSON .catch(error =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;Error fetching data:\u0026#34;, error)); 🔥 Comparison: Axios vs. Fetch Feature Axios Fetch JSON Parsing ✅ Auto ❌ Manual (.json()) Error Handling ✅ Rejects on HTTP errors ❌ Only rejects on network errors Request Headers ✅ Easy ❌ Manual setup required async/await Support ✅ Yes ✅ Yes Default Timeout ✅ Yes (timeout option) ❌ No 👉 Best Practice: Use Axios when working with APIs that require headers, authentication, or advanced error handling.\nPromise in JavaScript A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.\n👉 It has three states:\nPending → Initial state, neither resolved nor rejected. Fulfilled → Operation completed successfully. Rejected → Operation failed. let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { fetch(`https://randomuser.me/api/`) .then((raw) =\u0026gt; raw.json()) .then((result) =\u0026gt; { if (result.results[0].gender === \u0026#34;male\u0026#34;) { resolve(); } else { reject(); } }); }); promise .then(function () { console.log(\u0026#34;Male Received\u0026#34;); }) .catch(function () { console.log(\u0026#34;Female Received\u0026#34;); }); Callbacks in JavaScript A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.\n👉 Why use callbacks?\nHandle asynchronous operations (like fetching data, timers, or reading files). Execute code after another function completes. function getData(url, callback) { fetch(`https://randomuser.me/api/`) .then((raw) =\u0026gt; raw.json()) .then((result) =\u0026gt; { callback(result); }); } getData(\u0026#34;https://randomuser.me/api/\u0026#34;, function (result) { console.log( result.results[0].gender, result.results[0].name.first, result.results[0].email, ); }); async/await async/await is a modern way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.\nIt allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and debug.\n👉 Key Features:\n✔️ **async: **The async keyword is used before a function definition to make it return a Promise. ✔️ await: The await keyword is used inside an async function to pause execution until a Promise resolves. ✔️ Avoids callback hell and complex .then() chains.\n✔️ Handles errors with try/catch.\nasync function func() { let n = await fetch(`https://randomuser.me/api/`); n = await n.json(); console.log(n.results[0].gender); } func(); When to Use async/await? ✔️ Fetching data from an API\n✔️ Performing database queries\n✔️ Reading/Writing files (in Node.js)\n✔️ Processing multiple async requests together\n✔️ Avoiding callback hell\nEvent Loop To understand the Event Loop, you need to know how JavaScript executes code. It has three main components:\nCall Stack The Call Stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. It executes synchronous JavaScript code line by line. function greet() { console.log(\u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;); } greet(); 📌 Execution:\ngreet() is pushed onto the Call Stack. console.log(\u0026quot;Hello!\u0026quot;) runs and is popped from the stack. Web APIs (Async Tasks) JavaScript delegates async tasks (e.g., setTimeout, fetch, event listeners) to Web APIs. These APIs handle the task in the background and return the result later. Example:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Start\u0026#34;); setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Inside setTimeout\u0026#34;); }, 1000); console.log(\u0026#34;End\u0026#34;); 📌 Execution Flow:\nconsole.log(\u0026quot;Start\u0026quot;) → Executes immediately. setTimeout() → Sent to Web API, NOT executed immediately. console.log(\u0026quot;End\u0026quot;) → Executes immediately. After 1 second, the callback (console.log(\u0026quot;Inside setTimeout\u0026quot;)) moves to Callback Queue. Callback Queue \u0026amp; Microtask Queue Callback Queue: Stores callbacks from setTimeout, setInterval, event listeners. Microtask Queue: Stores callbacks from Promises (.then(), catch(), finally()) and MutationObserver. Microtasks always run before Callbacks (higher priority). Example:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Start\u0026#34;); setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;Timeout Callback\u0026#34;), 0); Promise.resolve().then(() =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;Promise Resolved\u0026#34;)); console.log(\u0026#34;End\u0026#34;); 📌 Execution Flow:\nconsole.log(\u0026quot;Start\u0026quot;) → Runs immediately. setTimeout() → Sent to Web API (callback moved to Callback Queue). Promise.resolve().then(...) → Sent to Microtask Queue. console.log(\u0026quot;End\u0026quot;) → Runs immediately. Microtask Queue executes first → console.log(\u0026quot;Promise Resolved\u0026quot;). Callback Queue executes → console.log(\u0026quot;Timeout Callback\u0026quot;). How the Event Loop Works 1️⃣ JavaScript executes synchronous code in the Call Stack. 2️⃣ If an async task is encountered, it moves to the Web API. 3️⃣ Once completed, it moves the callback to the Callback Queue or Microtask Queue. 4️⃣ The Event Loop checks if the Call Stack is empty. 5️⃣ If empty, it first executes Microtasks, then moves Callbacks from the Callback Queue. 6️⃣ Repeats the process infinitely.\n🚀 Key Takeaways ✔ JavaScript is single-threaded but handles async tasks with the Event Loop.\n✔ Microtask Queue (Promises) runs before the Callback Queue (setTimeout).\n✔ The Event Loop ensures JavaScript never blocks execution.\n✔ Long-running tasks should be asynchronous to avoid UI freezing.\nDifference Between Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await Feature Callbacks Promises Async/Await Definition A function passed as an argument to another function and executed later. An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. A modern way to handle asynchronous code using async and await keywords. Syntax Nested functions, leading to callback hell. Uses .then(), .catch(), and .finally(). Uses async to declare functions and await to handle promises. Readability Hard to read and maintain due to callback nesting. More readable but still involves chaining. Clean and synchronous-like syntax. Error Handling Error-prone, requires manual handling (if-else or separate error callback). Uses .catch() to handle errors. Uses try...catch for better error handling. Chaining Difficult, leads to callback hell (Pyramid of Doom). Easy with .then() chaining. Simplifies chaining with await. Execution Flow Asynchronous but difficult to manage for multiple tasks. More manageable, but chaining can still be tricky. Most intuitive, executes sequentially like synchronous code. Best For Simple async operations, event listeners. Handling multiple asynchronous operations in a cleaner way. Writing clean, readable, and maintainable async code. Generators in JavaScript Generators are special functions in JavaScript that allow us to pause and resume execution. Unlike normal functions, they do not execute all at once; instead, they produce values one at a time as requested.\nKey Features of Generators ✔ Uses the function* syntax (notice the * after function).\n✔ Uses the yield keyword to pause execution and return values.\n✔ The function doesn’t run immediately; instead, it returns an iterator object.\n✔ The next() method resumes execution from the last yield.\nfunction* myGenerator() { console.log(\u0026#34;Start\u0026#34;); yield 1; // Pause and return 1 console.log(\u0026#34;Resume\u0026#34;); yield 2; // Pause and return 2 console.log(\u0026#34;End\u0026#34;); } const gen = myGenerator(); // Creates the generator object console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 1, done: false } console.log(gen.next().value); // 2 console.log(gen.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true } 📌 How it Works? Calling myGenerator() doesn\u0026rsquo;t execute it immediately. It returns a generator object (gen). gen.next() starts execution until the first yield, returning { value: 1, done: false }. Calling gen.next() again resumes execution after the first yield, printing \u0026quot;Resume\u0026quot; and yielding { value: 2, done: false }. When there are no more yield statements, done: true is returned. Generator with for...of Loop Instead of calling next() manually, we can use a for...of loop.\nfunction* fruits() { yield \u0026#34;🍎 Apple\u0026#34;; yield \u0026#34;🍌 Banana\u0026#34;; yield \u0026#34;🍇 Grapes\u0026#34;; } for (let fruit of fruits()) { console.log(fruit); } Generators vs Async/Await Feature Generators Async/Await Execution Can be paused/resumed using yield Pauses execution until a Promise resolves Returns Iterator object Promise Use Case Custom iteration, state management Handling async operations When to Use Generators? ✔ Custom Iterators – Iterating over data in a custom way.\n✔ Lazy Execution – Generate values on demand instead of all at once.\n✔ Infinite Sequences – Generate values infinitely without memory issues.\n✔ Asynchronous Programming (with co-routines) – Generators can be combined with Promises.\nWeb Worker Web Workers allow JavaScript to run background tasks in a separate thread without blocking the main UI thread. This helps in handling heavy computations and keeping the web page responsive.\nWhy Use Web Workers? ✔ JavaScript is single-threaded (blocking UI when executing long tasks).\n✔ Web Workers allow running tasks in parallel on a different thread.\n✔ Helps in CPU-intensive tasks like image processing, large calculations, etc.\n✔ Keeps the UI smooth and prevents the page from freezing.\n🚀 Step 1: Create the Worker (heavyWorker.js)\nonmessage = function (data) { let ans = data.data.reduce((acc, item) =\u0026gt; item + acc, 0); postMessage(ans); }; 🚀 Step 2: Use the Worker in Your Main Script (main.js)\nlet nums = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, b) =\u0026gt; b + 1); let worker = new Worker(\u0026#34;worker.js\u0026#34;); worker.postMessage(nums); worker.onmessage = function (data) { console.log(data.data); }; Limitations of Web Workers ❌ No DOM Access – Cannot manipulate HTML directly.\n❌ Cannot use window, document, or alert() – Only limited APIs like fetch(), WebSockets, and IndexedDB.\n❌ Same-Origin Policy – Workers must be loaded from the same domain.\n❌ Extra Resource Consumption – Creating multiple workers consumes more memory.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/asynchronous-js/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"synchronous-vs-asynchronous-javascript\"\u003eSynchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavaScript is \u003cstrong\u003esingle-threaded\u003c/strong\u003e, meaning it executes one operation at a time in a sequential manner.

Its code, known as scripts, is directly embedded within HTML documents and executed by the browser as soon as the page loads. Because these scripts are delivered and interpreted as plain text, they bypass the need for a separate compilation process—this makes development swift and flexible.\nThis interpretive nature is a key characteristic of JavaScript and distinguishes it from compiled languages like Java. Whereas Java requires a compile step to transform code into bytecode before execution, JavaScript’s immediate execution model facilitates rapid testing and iterative development. Over time, JavaScript has evolved from a simple tool for adding interactivity to a robust language capable of handling complex web applications, manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), and even running on servers through environments like Node.js.\nIn essence, JavaScript’s design philosophy—enabling live, responsive web experiences with minimal overhead—continues to shape the modern, dynamic web.\nTip: Brendan Eich is the original developer of JavaScript\nWhy is it called JavaScript?\nWhen JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.\nBut as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.\nToday, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.\nThe browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.\nDifferent engines have different “codenames”. For example:\nV8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge. SpiderMonkey – in Firefox. …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc. The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.\nHow do engines work?\nEngines are complicated. But the basics are easy.\nThe engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script. Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to machine code. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast. The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.\nWhat makes JavaScript unique? There are at least three great things about JavaScript:\nFull integration with HTML/CSS. Simple things are done simply. Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default. Link JavaScript to HTML We can use a \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag to add JavaScript code to a page. The type and language attributes are not required. A script in an external file can be inserted with \u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;path/to/script.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;. Please note: As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.\nThe benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.\nOther pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.\nThat reduces traffic and makes pages faster.\nSemicolons A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. This would also work:\nconsole.log(\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;) console.log(\u0026#39;World\u0026#39;) Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.\nIn most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!\nThere are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:\nconsole.log(3 + 1 + 2); The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo;, then it is an “incomplete expression”, so a semicolon there would be incorrect. And in this case, that works as intended.\nBut there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.\nErrors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.\nAn example of an error\nIf you’re curious to see a concrete example of such an error, check this code out:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); [1, 2].forEach(console.log); Now let’s remove the semicolon after the console.log:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) [1, 2].forEach(console.log); The difference compared to the code above is only one character: the semicolon at the end of the first line is gone.\nIf we run this code, only the first Hello shows (and there’s an error, you may need to open the console to see it). There are no numbers any more.\nThat’s because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So, the code in the last example is treated as a single statement.\nHere’s how the engine sees it:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;)[1, 2].forEach(console.log); It\u0026rsquo;s recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let’s note once again – it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them.\nComments As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.\nComments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.\nOne-line comments start with two forward slash characters //. The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement. Like here:\n// This comment occupies a line of its own console.log(\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;World\u0026#39;); // This comment follows the statement Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */. /* An example with two messages. This is a multiline comment. */ console.log(\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;World\u0026#39;); Nested comments are not supported! There may not be /\u0026hellip;/ inside another /\u0026hellip;/.\nSuch code will die with an error:\n/* /* nested comment ?!? */ not allowed */ console.log( \u0026#39;World\u0026#39; ); The modern mode, \u0026ldquo;use strict\u0026rdquo; The directive looks like a string: \u0026quot;use strict\u0026quot; or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.\n\u0026#34;use strict\u0026#34;; // this code works the modern way ... Advance that \u0026quot;use strict\u0026quot; can be put at the beginning of a function. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. But usually people use it for the whole script.\nEnsure that “use strict” is at the top\nPlease make sure that \u0026quot;use strict\u0026quot; is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled. Strict mode isn’t enabled here:\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;some code\u0026#34;); // \u0026#34;use strict\u0026#34; below is ignored--it must be at the top \u0026#34;use strict\u0026#34;; // strict mode is not activated Should we “use strict”? The question may sound obvious, but it’s not so.\nOne could recommend to start scripts with \u0026ldquo;use strict\u0026rdquo;… But you know what’s cool?\nModern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable use strict automatically. So we don’t need to add the \u0026ldquo;use strict\u0026rdquo; directive, if we use them.\nSo, for now \u0026ldquo;use strict\u0026rdquo;; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.\nAs of now, we’ve got to know about use strict in general.\nIn the next chapters, as we learn language features, we’ll see the differences between the strict and old modes. Luckily, there aren’t many and they actually make our lives better.\nThe purpose of \u0026quot;use strict\u0026quot; is to indicate that the code should be executed in \u0026ldquo;strict mode\u0026rdquo;.\nWith strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.\nJavaScript Window - The Browser Object Model In JavaScript, window is a global object that represents the browser window or tab. It is the top-level object in the browser\u0026rsquo;s client-side execution environment and provides access to various properties and methods for controlling the browser window.\nconsole The console object provides access to the browser\u0026rsquo;s debugging console.\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;); console.warn(\u0026#34;Be carefull\u0026#34;); console.error(\u0026#34;You made a mistake\u0026#34;); log(): Outputs a message to the console. warn(): Outputs a warning message to the console. error(): Outputs an error message to the console. clear(): Clears the console. Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm As we’ll be using the browser as our demo environment, let’s see a couple of functions to interact with the user: alert, prompt and confirm.\nalert() The alert() method displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.\nThe alert() method is used when you want information to come through to the user.\nalert(\u0026#34;Hello\\nHow are you?\u0026#34;); prompt() The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input.\nThe prompt() method returns the input value if the user clicks \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, otherwise it returns null.\nA prompt box is used if you want the user to input a value.\nWhen a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo; to proceed.\nDo not overuse this method. It prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page until the box is closed.\nresult = prompt(title, [default]); let age = prompt(\u0026#39;How old are you?\u0026#39;, 100); console.log(`You are ${age} years old!`); // You are 100 years old! confirm() The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a message, an OK button, and a Cancel button.\nThe confirm() method returns true if the user clicked \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;, otherwise false.\nA confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.\nA confirm box takes the focus away from the current window, and forces the user to read the message.\nDo not overuse this method. It prevents the user from accessing other parts of the page until the box is closed.\nVariables A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.\nTo create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.\nThe statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:\nlet message; Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:\nlet message; message = \u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;; // store the string \u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39; in the variable named message The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:\nlet message; message = \u0026#39;Hello!\u0026#39;; console.log(message); // shows the variable content To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:\nlet message = \u0026#39;Hello!\u0026#39;; // define the variable and assign the value console.log(message); // Hello! We can also declare multiple variables in one line:\nlet user = \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, age = 25, message = \u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;; That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.\nThe multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:\nlet user = \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;; let age = 25; let message = \u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;; Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it’s a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.\nvar instead of let\nIn older scripts, you may also find another keyword: var instead of let:\n`_var_` message `=` `'Hello'``;`\nThe var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.\nbut the main difference Variables, declared with var, are either function-scoped or global-scoped. They are visible through blocks.\nThere are subtle differences between let and var, but they do not matter to us yet. We’ll cover them in detail in the chapter The old \u0026ldquo;var\u0026rdquo;.\nFunctional languages\nIt’s interesting to note that there exist so-called pure functional programming languages, such as Haskell, that forbid changing variable values.\nIn such languages, once the value is stored “in the box”, it’s there forever. If we need to store something else, the language forces us to create a new box (declare a new variable). We can’t reuse the old one.\nThough it may seem a little odd at first sight, these languages are quite capable of serious development. More than that, there are areas like parallel computations where this limitation confers certain benefits.\nConstants To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:\nconst myBirthday = \u0026#39;18.04.1982\u0026#39;; Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:\nconst myBirthday = \u0026#39;18.04.1982\u0026#39;; myBirthday = \u0026#39;01.01.2001\u0026#39;; // error, can\u0026#39;t reassign the constant! When a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can declare it with const to guarantee and communicate that fact to everyone.\nUppercase constants There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known before execution.\nSuch constants are named using capital letters and underscores.\nFor instance, let’s make constants for colors in so-called “web” (hexadecimal) format:\nconst COLOR_RED = \u0026#34;#F00\u0026#34;; const COLOR_GREEN = \u0026#34;#0F0\u0026#34;; const COLOR_BLUE = \u0026#34;#00F\u0026#34;; const COLOR_ORANGE = \u0026#34;#FF7F00\u0026#34;; // ...when we need to pick a color let color = COLOR_ORANGE; console.log(color); // #FF7F00 COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than \u0026quot;#FF7F00\u0026quot;. It is much easier to mistype \u0026quot;#FF7F00\u0026quot; than COLOR_ORANGE. When reading the code, COLOR_ORANGE is much more meaningful than #FF7F00. When should we use capitals for a constant and when should we name it normally? Let’s make that clear.\nBeing a “constant” just means that a variable’s value never changes. But some constants are known before execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and some constants are calculated in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.\nconst pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */; The value of pageLoadTime is not known before the page load, so it’s named normally. But it’s still a constant because it doesn’t change after the assignment.\nIn other words, capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.\nData types A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.\nWe can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:\n// no error let message = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;; message = 123456; Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.\n1. Number: The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.\nlet n = 123; n = 12.345; There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.\nBesides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.\nInfinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number. console.log( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity Or just reference it directly:\nNaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance: console.log( \u0026#34;not a number\u0026#34; / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous NaN is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on NaN returns NaN:\nconsole.log( NaN + 1 ); // NaN console.log( 3 * NaN ); // NaN console.log( \u0026#34;not a number\u0026#34; / 2 - 1 ); // NaN So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result (there’s only one exception to that: NaN ** 0 is 1).\nBigInt In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot safely represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.\nTo be really precise, the “number” type can store larger integers (up to 1.7976931348623157 * 10308), but outside of the safe integer range ±(253-1) there’ll be a precision error, because not all digits fit into the fixed 64-bit storage. So an “approximate” value may be stored.\nconsole.log(9007199254740991 + 1); // 9007199254740992 console.log(9007199254740991 + 2); // 9007199254740992 So to say, all odd integers greater than (253-1) can’t be stored at all in the “number” type.\nFor most purposes ±(253-1) range is quite enough, but sometimes we need the entire range of really big integers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.\nBigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.\nA BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:\n// the \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; at the end means it\u0026#39;s a BigInt const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; 2. String A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.\nlet str = \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;; let str2 = \u0026#39;Single quotes are ok too\u0026#39;; let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`; In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.\nDouble quotes: \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;. Single quotes: 'Hello'. Backticks: `Hello`. Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.\nBackticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:\nlet name = \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;; // embed a variable console.log( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John! // embed an expression console.log( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3 There is no character type.\nIn some languages, there is a special “character” type for a single character. For example, in the C language and in Java it is called “char”.\nIn JavaScript, there is no such type. There’s only one type: string. A string may consist of zero characters (be empty), one character or many of them.\n3. Boolean (logical type) The boolean type has only two values: true and false.\nThis type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.\nFor instance:\nlet nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked 4. The “null” value The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.\nIt forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:\nlet age = null; In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.\nIt’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.\nThe code above states that age is unknown.\nThe \u0026ldquo;undefined\u0026rdquo; value The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.\nThe meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.\nIf a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:\nlet age; console.log(age); // shows \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34; Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable:\nlet age = 100; // change the value to undefined age = undefined; console.log(age); // \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34; …But it\u0026rsquo;s don’t recommend doing that. Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.\nObjects and Symbols The object type is special.\nAll other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.\nBeing that important, objects deserve a special treatment. Deal with them later in the chapter Objects, after we learn more about primitives.\nThe symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.\nThe typeof operator The typeof operator returns the type of the operand. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.\nA call to typeof x returns a string with the type name:\ntypeof undefined // \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34; typeof 0 // \u0026#34;number\u0026#34; typeof 10n // \u0026#34;bigint\u0026#34; typeof true // \u0026#34;boolean\u0026#34; typeof \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; // \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; typeof Symbol(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;) // \u0026#34;symbol\u0026#34; typeof Math // \u0026#34;object\u0026#34; (1) typeof null // \u0026#34;object\u0026#34; (2) typeof alert// \u0026#34;function\u0026#34; (3) The typeof(x) syntax\nYou may also come across another syntax: typeof(x). It’s the same as typeof x.\nTo put it clear: typeof is an operator, not a function. The parentheses here aren’t a part of typeof. It’s the kind of parentheses used for mathematical grouping.\nUsually, such parentheses contain a mathematical expression, such as (2 + 2), but here they contain only one argument (x). Syntactically, they allow to avoid a space between the typeof operator and its argument, and some people like it.\nSome people prefer typeof(x), although the typeof x syntax is much more common.\nType Conversions Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.\nFor example, console.log automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.\nThere are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.\nString Conversion String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.\nFor example, console.log(value) does it to show the value.\nWe can also call the String(value) function to convert a value to a string:\nlet value = true; console.log(typeof value); // boolean value = String(value); // now value is a string \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; console.log(typeof value); // string String conversion is mostly obvious. A false becomes \u0026quot;false\u0026quot;, null becomes \u0026quot;null\u0026quot;, etc.\nNumeric Conversion Numeric conversion in mathematical functions and expressions happens automatically.\nFor example, when division / is applied to non-numbers:\nconsole.log( \u0026#34;6\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers We can use the Number(value) function to explicitly convert a value to a number:\nlet str = \u0026#34;123\u0026#34;; console.log(typeof str); // string let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123 console.log(typeof num); // number Explicit conversion is usually required when we read a value from a string-based source like a text form but expect a number to be entered.\nIf the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is NaN. For instance:\nlet age = Number(\u0026#34;an arbitrary string instead of a number\u0026#34;); console.log(age); // NaN, conversion failed Numeric conversion rules:\nValue Becomes… undefined NaN null 0 true and false 1 and 0 string Whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs \\t, newlines \\n etc.) from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is 0. Otherwise, the number is “read” from the string. An error gives NaN. console.log( Number(\u0026#34; 123 \u0026#34;) ); // 123 console.log( Number(\u0026#34;123z\u0026#34;) ); // NaN (error reading a number at \u0026#34;z\u0026#34;) console.log( Number(true) ); // 1 console.log( Number(false) ); // 0 Boolean Conversion Boolean conversion is the simplest one.\nIt happens in logical operations (later we’ll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to Boolean(value).\nThe conversion rule:\nValues that are intuitively “empty”, like 0, an empty string, null, undefined, and NaN, become false. Other values become true. console.log( Boolean(1) ); // true console.log( Boolean(0) ); // false console.log( Boolean(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;) ); // true console.log( Boolean(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) ); // false Please note: the string with zero \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; is true\nSome languages (namely PHP) treat \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; as false. But in JavaScript, a non-empty string is always true.\nalert( Boolean(\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;) ); // true alert( Boolean(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;) ); // spaces, also true (any non-empty string is true) Basic operators, maths We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, and so on.\nIn this chapter, we’ll start with simple operators, then concentrate on JavaScript-specific aspects, not covered by school arithmetic.\nMaths The following math operations are supported:\nAddition +, Subtraction -, Multiplication *, Division /, Remainder %, Exponentiation **. Remainder The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.\nThe result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.\nFor instance:\nconsole.log(5 % 2); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2 console.log(8 % 3); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3 console.log(8 % 4); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4 Exponentiation: The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b.\nIn school maths, we write that as ab.\nFor instance:\nconsole.log(2 ** 2); // 2² = 4 console.log(2 ** 3); // 2³ = 8 console.log(2 ** 4); // 2⁴ = 16 Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.\nFor example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:\nconsole.log(4 ** (1 / 2)); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root) console.log(8 ** (1 / 3)); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root) String concatenation with binary Let’s meet the features of JavaScript operators that are beyond school arithmetics.\nUsually, the plus operator + sums numbers.\nBut, if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:\nlet s = \u0026#34;my\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;; console.log(s); // mystring Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.\nconsole.log( \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; + 2 ); // \u0026#34;12\u0026#34; console.log( 2 + \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; ); // \u0026#34;21\u0026#34; See, it doesn’t matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.\nHere’s a more complex example:\nconsole.log(2 + 2 + \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; ); // \u0026#34;41\u0026#34; and not \u0026#34;221\u0026#34; Here, operators work one after another. The first + sums two numbers, so it returns 4, then the next + adds the string 1 to it, so it’s like 4 + '1' = '41'.\nconsole.log(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39; + 2 + 2); // \u0026#34;122\u0026#34; and not \u0026#34;14\u0026#34; The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.\nHere’s the demo for subtraction and division:\nconsole.log( 6 - \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; ); // 4, converts \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; to a number console.log( \u0026#39;6\u0026#39; / \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers Numeric conversion, unary The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form that we used above and the unary form.\nThe unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.\nFor example:\n// No effect on numbers let x = 1; console.log( +x ); // 1 let y = -2; console.log( +y ); // -2 // Converts non-numbers console.log( +true ); // 1 console.log( +\u0026#34;\u0026#34; ); // 0 It actually does the same thing as Number(...), but is shorter.\nThe binary plus would add them as strings:\nlet apples = \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;; let oranges = \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;; console.log( apples + oranges ); // \u0026#34;23\u0026#34;, the binary plus concatenates strings If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:\nlet apples = \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;; let oranges = \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;; // both values converted to numbers before the binary plus console.log( +apples + +oranges ); // 5 // the longer variant // console.log( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5 From a mathematician’s standpoint, the abundance of pluses may seem strange. But from a programmer’s standpoint, there’s nothing special: unary pluses are applied first, they convert strings to numbers, and then the binary plus sums them up.\nOperator Precedence: If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their precedence, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.\nPrecedence Name Sign … … … 14 unary plus + 14 unary negation - 13 exponentiation ** 12 multiplication * 12 division / 11 addition + 11 subtraction - … … … 2 assignment = … … … Assignment Let’s note that an assignment = is also an operator. It is listed in the precedence table with the very low priority of 2.\nThat’s why, when we assign a variable, like x = 2 * 2 + 1, the calculations are done first and then the = is evaluated, storing the result in x.\nlet x = 2 * 2 + 1; console.log( x ); // 5 Assignment = returns a value The fact of = being an operator, not a “magical” language construct has an interesting implication.\nAll operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious for + and -, but also true for =.\nThe call x = value writes the value into x and then returns it.\nHere’s a demo that uses an assignment as part of a more complex expression:\nlet a = 1; let b = 2; let c = 3 - (a = b + 1); console.log( a ); // 3 console.log c ); // 0 In the example above, the result of expression (a = b + 1) is the value which was assigned to a (that is 3). It is then used for further evaluations.\nFunny code, isn’t it? We should understand how it works, because sometimes we see it in JavaScript libraries.\nAlthough, please don’t write the code like that. Such tricks definitely don’t make code clearer or readable.\nModify-in-place We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.\nFor example:\nlet n = 2; n = n + 5; n = n * 2; This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:\nlet n = 2; n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5) n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2) alert( n ); // 14 Increment/decrement Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.\nSo, there are special operators for it:\nIncrement ++ increases a variable by 1: let counter = 2; counter++; // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter alert( counter ); // 3 Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1: let counter = 2; counter--; // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter alert( counter ); // 1 Important: Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.\nThe operators ++ and -- can be placed either before or after a variable.\nWhen the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++. The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter. Both of these statements do the same thing: increase counter by 1.\nIs there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of ++/--.\nLet’s clarify. As we know, all operators return a value. Increment/decrement is no exception. The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).\nTo see the difference, here’s an example:\nlet counter = 1; let a = ++counter; // (*) alert(a); // 2 In the line (*), the prefix form ++counter increments counter and returns the new value, 2. So, the alert shows 2.\nNow, let’s use the postfix form:\nlet counter = 1; let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++ alert(a); // 1 In the line (*), the postfix form counter++ also increments counter but returns the old value (prior to increment). So, the alert shows 1.\nIncrement/decrement among other operators\nThe operators ++/-- can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other arithmetical operations.\nFor instance:\nlet counter = 1; alert( 2 * ++counter ); // 4 Compare With:\nlet counter = 1; alert( 2 * counter++ ); // 2, because counter++ returns the \u0026#34;old\u0026#34; value Though technically okay, such notation usually makes code less readable. One line does multiple things – not good.\nWhile reading code, a fast “vertical” eye-scan can easily miss something like counter++ and it won’t be obvious that the variable increased.\nWe advise a style of “one line – one action”:\nlet counter = 1; alert( 2 * counter ); counter++; Bitwise operators Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.\nThese operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.\nThe list of operators:\nAND ( \u0026amp; ) OR ( | ) XOR ( ^ ) NOT ( ~ ) LEFT SHIFT ( \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ) RIGHT SHIFT ( \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ) ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ) These operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level. We won’t need these operators any time soon, as web development has little use of them, but in some special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful. You can read the Bitwise Operators chapter on MDN when a need arises.\nComma The comma operator , is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes, it’s used to write shorter code, so we need to know it in order to understand what’s going on.\nThe comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.\nlet a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4); alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4) Here, the first expression 1 + 2 is evaluated and its result is thrown away. Then, 3 + 4 is evaluated and returned as the result.\nComma has a very low precedence\nPlease note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than =, so parentheses are important in the example above.\nWithout them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers into a = 3, 7, then the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored. It’s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.\nWhy do we need an operator that throws away everything except the last expression?\nSometimes, people use it in more complex constructs to put several actions in one line.\nFor example:\n// three operations in one line for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a \u0026lt; 10; a++) { ... } Comparisons We know many comparison operators from maths.\nIn JavaScript they are written like this:\nGreater/less than: a \u0026gt; b, a \u0026lt; b. Greater/less than or equals: a \u0026gt;= b, a \u0026lt;= b. Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment. Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b. In this article we’ll learn more about different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes them, including important peculiarities.\nAt the end you’ll find a good recipe to avoid “JavaScript quirks”-related issues.\nBoolean is the result All comparison operators return a boolean value:\ntrue – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”. false – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”. For example:\nconsole.log( 2 \u0026gt; 1 ); // true (correct) console.log( 2 == 1 ); // false (wrong) console.log( 2 != 1 ); // true (correct) A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value:\nlet result = 5 \u0026gt; 4; // assign the result of the comparison console.log( result ); // true String comparison To see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called “dictionary” or “lexicographical” order.\nIn other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.\nFor example:\nconsole.log( \u0026#39;Z\u0026#39; \u0026gt; \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; ); // true console.log( \u0026#39;Glow\u0026#39; \u0026gt; \u0026#39;Glee\u0026#39; ); // true console.log( \u0026#39;Bee\u0026#39; \u0026gt; \u0026#39;Be\u0026#39; ); // true The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:\nCompare the first character of both strings. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done. Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way. Repeat until the end of either string. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater. In the first example above, the comparison 'Z' \u0026gt; 'A' gets to a result at the first step.\nThe second comparison 'Glow' and 'Glee' needs more steps as strings are compared character-by-character:\nG is the same as G. l is the same as l. o is greater than e. Stop here. The first string is greater. Not a real dictionary, but Unicode order\nThe comparison algorithm given above is roughly equivalent to the one used in dictionaries or phone books, but it’s not exactly the same.\nFor instance, case matters. A capital letter \u0026quot;A\u0026quot; is not equal to the lowercase \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;. Which one is greater? The lowercase \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;. Why? Because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding table JavaScript uses (Unicode). We’ll get back to specific details and consequences of this in the chapter Strings.\nComparison of different types When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.\nFor example:\nconsole.log( \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; \u0026gt; 1 ); // true, string \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; becomes a number 2 console.log( \u0026#39;01\u0026#39; == 1 ); // true, string \u0026#39;01\u0026#39; becomes a number 1 For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.\nFor example:\nalert( true == 1 ); // true alert( false == 0 ); // true A funny consequence\nIt is possible that at the same time:\nTwo values are equal. One of them is true as a boolean and the other one is false as a boolean. For example:\nlet a = 0; alert( Boolean(a) ); // false let b = \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;; alert( Boolean(b) ); // true alert(a == b); // true! From JavaScript’s standpoint, this result is quite normal. An equality check converts values using the numeric conversion (hence \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; becomes 0), while the explicit Boolean conversion uses another set of rules.\nStrict equality A regular equality check == has a problem. It cannot differentiate 0 from false:\nalert( 0 == false ); // true The same thing happens with an empty string:\nalert( \u0026#39;\u0026#39; == false ); // true This happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator ==. An empty string, just like false, becomes a zero.\nWhat to do if we’d like to differentiate 0 from false?\nA strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.\nIn other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.\nLet’s try it:\nalert( 0 === false ); // false, because the types are different There is also a “strict non-equality” operator !== analogous to !=.\nThe strict equality operator is a bit longer to write, but makes it obvious what’s going on and leaves less room for errors.\nComparison with null and undefined There’s a non-intuitive behavior when null or undefined are compared to other values.\nFor a strict equality check ===\nThese values are different, because each of them is a different type.\nalert( null === undefined ); // false For a non-strict check ==\nThere’s a special rule. These two are a “sweet couple”: they equal each other (in the sense of ==), but not any other value.\nFor maths and other comparisons \u0026lt; \u0026gt; \u0026lt;= \u0026gt;=\nnull/undefined are converted to numbers: null becomes 0, while undefined becomes NaN.\nNow let’s see some funny things that happen when we apply these rules. And, what’s more important, how to not fall into a trap with them.\nStrange result: null vs 0 Let’s compare null with a zero:\nalert( null \u0026gt; 0 ); // (1) false alert( null == 0 ); // (2) false alert( null \u0026gt;= 0 ); // (3) true Mathematically, that’s strange. The last result states that “null is greater than or equal to zero”, so in one of the comparisons above it must be true, but they are both false.\nThe reason is that an equality check == and comparisons \u0026gt; \u0026lt; \u0026gt;= \u0026lt;= work differently. Comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0. That’s why (3) null \u0026gt;= 0 is true and (1) null \u0026gt; 0 is false.\nOn the other hand, the equality check == for undefined and null is defined such that, without any conversions, they equal each other and don’t equal anything else. That’s why (2) null == 0 is false.\nAn incomparable undefined The value undefined shouldn’t be compared to other values:\nalert( undefined \u0026gt; 0 ); // false (1) alert( undefined \u0026lt; 0 ); // false (2) alert( undefined == 0 ); // false (3) Why does it dislike zero so much? Always false!\nWe get these results because:\nComparisons (1) and (2) return false because undefined gets converted to NaN and NaN is a special numeric value which returns false for all comparisons. The equality check (3) returns false because undefined only equals null, undefined, and no other value. Avoid Problems Why did we go over these examples? Should we remember these peculiarities all the time? Well, not really. Actually, these tricky things will gradually become familiar over time, but there’s a solid way to avoid problems with them:\nTreat any comparison with undefined/null except the strict equality === with exceptional care. Don’t use comparisons \u0026gt;= \u0026gt; \u0026lt; \u0026lt;= with a variable which may be null/undefined, unless you’re really sure of what you’re doing. If a variable can have these values, check for them separately. Conditional branching: if, \u0026lsquo;?\u0026rsquo; Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.\nTo do that, we can use the if statement and the conditional operator ?, that’s also called a “question mark” operator.\nThe “if” statement The if(...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code.\nFor example:\nlet year = prompt(\u0026#34;In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); if (year == 2015) alert(\u0026#34;You are right!\u0026#34;); In the example above, the condition is a simple equality check (year == 2015), but it can be much more complex.\nIf we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:\nif (year == 2015) { alert( \u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s correct!\u0026#34; ); alert( \u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re so smart!\u0026#34; ); } We recommend wrapping your code block with curly braces {} every time you use an if statement, even if there is only one statement to execute. Doing so improves readability\nBoolean conversion The if (…) statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.\nLet’s recall the conversion rules from the chapter Type Conversions:\nA number 0, an empty string \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called “falsy” values. Other values become true, so they are called “truthy”. So, the code under this condition would never execute:\nif (0) { // 0 is falsy ... } …and inside this condition – it always will:\nif (1) { // 1 is truthy ... } We can also pass a pre-evaluated boolean value to if, like this:\nlet cond = (year == 2015); // equality evaluates to true or false if (cond) { ... } The “else” clause The if statement may contain an optional else block. It executes when the condition is falsy.\nFor example:\nlet year = prompt(\u0026#39;In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;); if (year == 2015) { alert( \u0026#39;You guessed it right!\u0026#39; ); } else { alert( \u0026#39;How can you be so wrong?\u0026#39; ); // any value except 2015 } Several conditions: “else if” Sometimes, we’d like to test several variants of a condition. The else if clause lets us do that.\nFor example:\nlet year = prompt(\u0026#39;In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;); if (year \u0026lt; 2015) { alert( \u0026#39;Too early...\u0026#39; ); } else if (year \u0026gt; 2015) { alert( \u0026#39;Too late\u0026#39; ); } else { alert( \u0026#39;Exactly!\u0026#39; ); } In the code above, JavaScript first checks year \u0026lt; 2015. If that is falsy, it goes to the next condition year \u0026gt; 2015. If that is also falsy, it shows the last alert.\nThere can be more else if blocks. The final else is optional.\nConditional operator ‘?’ Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.\nFor instance:\nlet accessAllowed; let age = prompt(\u0026#39;How old are you?\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;); if (age \u0026gt; 18) { accessAllowed = true; } else { accessAllowed = false; } alert(accessAllowed); The so-called “conditional” or “question mark” operator lets us do that in a shorter and simpler way.\nThe operator is represented by a question mark ?. Sometimes it’s called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.\nThe syntax is:\nlet result = condition ? value1 : value2; The condition is evaluated: if it’s truthy then value1 is returned, otherwise – value2.\nFor example:\nlet accessAllowed = (age \u0026gt; 18) ? true : false; Technically, we can omit the parentheses around age \u0026gt; 18. The question mark operator has a low precedence, so it executes after the comparison \u0026gt;.\nThis example will do the same thing as the previous one:\n// the comparison operator \u0026#34;age \u0026gt; 18\u0026#34; executes first anyway // (no need to wrap it into parentheses) let accessAllowed = age \u0026gt; 18 ? true : false; But parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.\nPlease note: In the example above, you can avoid using the question mark operator because the comparison itself returns true/false:\n// the same let accessAllowed = age \u0026gt; 18; Multiple ‘?’ A sequence of question mark operators ? can return a value that depends on more than one condition.\nFor instance:\nlet age = prompt(\u0026#34;age?\u0026#34;, 18); let message = age \u0026lt; 3 ? \u0026#34;Hi, baby!\u0026#34; : age \u0026lt; 18 ? \u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34; : age \u0026lt; 100 ? \u0026#34;Greetings!\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;What an unusual age!\u0026#34;; alert(message); It may be difficult at first to grasp what’s going on. But after a closer look, we can see that it’s just an ordinary sequence of tests:\nThe first question mark checks whether age \u0026lt; 3. If true – it returns 'Hi, baby!'. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the colon “:”, checking age \u0026lt; 18. If that’s true – it returns 'Hello!'. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the next colon “:”, checking age \u0026lt; 100. If that’s true – it returns 'Greetings!'. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the last colon “:”, returning 'What an unusual age!'. Here’s how this looks using if..else:\nif (age \u0026lt; 3) { message = \u0026#39;Hi, baby!\u0026#39;; } else if (age \u0026lt; 18) { message = \u0026#39;Hello!\u0026#39;; } else if (age \u0026lt; 100) { message = \u0026#39;Greetings!\u0026#39;; } else { message = \u0026#39;What an unusual age!\u0026#39;; } Logical operators There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing). Here we cover the first three, the ?? operator is in the next article.\nAlthough they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.\nLet’s see the details.\n|| (OR) The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:\nresult = a || b; In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.\nIn JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let’s see what happens with boolean values.\nThere are four possible logical combinations:\nconsole.log( true || true ); // true console.log( false || true ); // true console.log( true || false ); // true console.log( false || false ); // false As we can see, the result is always true except for the case when both operands are false.\nIf an operand is not a boolean, it’s converted to a boolean for the evaluation.\nFor instance, the number 1 is treated as true, the number 0 as false:\nif (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false ) alert( \u0026#39;truthy!\u0026#39; ); } Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is true.\nFor example:\nlet hour = 9; if (hour \u0026lt; 10 || hour \u0026gt; 18) { alert( \u0026#39;The office is closed.\u0026#39; ); } We can pass more conditions:\nlet hour = 12; let isWeekend = true; if (hour \u0026lt; 10 || hour \u0026gt; 18 || isWeekend) { alert( \u0026#39;The office is closed.\u0026#39; ); // it is the weekend } OR \u0026ldquo;||\u0026rdquo; finds the first truthy value The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let’s bring in the “extra” features of JavaScript.\nThe extended algorithm works as follows.\nGiven multiple OR’ed values:\nresult = value1 || value2 || value3; The OR || operator does the following:\nEvaluates operands from left to right. For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand. A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.\nIn other words, a chain of OR || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.\nFor instance:\nconsole.log(1 || 0); // 1 (1 is truthy) console.log(null || 1); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value) console.log(null || 0 || 1); // 1 (the first truthy value) console.log(undefined || null || 0); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value) This leads to some interesting usage compared to a “pure, classical, boolean-only OR”.\nGetting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions.\nFor instance, we have firstName, lastName and nickName variables, all optional (i.e. can be undefined or have falsy values).\nLet’s use OR || to choose the one that has the data and show it (or \u0026ldquo;Anonymous\u0026rdquo; if nothing set):\nlet firstName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; let lastName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; let nickName = \u0026#34;SuperCoder\u0026#34;; console.log( firstName || lastName || nickName || \u0026#34;Anonymous\u0026#34;); // SuperCoder If all variables were falsy, \u0026quot;Anonymous\u0026quot; would show up.\nShort-circuit evaluation.\nAnother feature of OR || operator is the so-called “short-circuit” evaluation.\nIt means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.\nThe importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn’t just a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call.\nIn the example below, only the second message is printed:\ntrue || alert(\u0026#34;not printed\u0026#34;); false || alert(\u0026#34;printed\u0026#34;); In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true, so the alert isn’t run.\nSometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy.\n\u0026amp;\u0026amp; (AND) The AND operator is represented with two ampersands \u0026amp;\u0026amp;:\nresult = a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b; In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise:\nconsole.log( true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; true ); // true console.log( false \u0026amp;\u0026amp; true ); // false console.log( true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; false ); // false console.log( false \u0026amp;\u0026amp; false ); // false An example with if:\nlet hour = 12; let minute = 30; if (hour == 12 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; minute == 30) { alert( \u0026#39;The time is 12:30\u0026#39; ); } Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:\nif (1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 0) { // evaluated as true \u0026amp;\u0026amp; false alert( \u0026#34;won\u0026#39;t work, because the result is falsy\u0026#34; ); } AND “\u0026amp;\u0026amp;” finds the first falsy value Given multiple AND’ed values:\nresult = value1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; value2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; value3; The AND \u0026amp;\u0026amp; operator does the following:\nEvaluates operands from left to right. For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand. In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.\nThe rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy value while OR returns the first truthy one.\nExamples:\n// if the first operand is truthy, // AND returns the second operand: alert( 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 0 ); // 0 alert( 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 5 ); // 5 // if the first operand is falsy, // AND returns it. The second operand is ignored alert( null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 5 ); // null alert( 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#34;no matter what\u0026#34; ); // 0 We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:\nalert( 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 3 ); // null When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:\nalert( 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; 3 ); // 3, the last one Precedence of AND \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is higher than OR || The precedence of AND \u0026amp;\u0026amp; operator is higher than OR ||.\nSo the code a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b || c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; d is essentially the same as if the \u0026amp;\u0026amp; expressions were in parentheses: (a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b) || (c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; d).\nDon’t replace if with || or \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\nSometimes, people use the AND \u0026amp;\u0026amp; operator as a “shorter way to write if”.\nFor instance:\nlet x = 1; (x \u0026gt; 0) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; alert( \u0026#39;Greater than zero!\u0026#39; ); The action in the right part of \u0026amp;\u0026amp; would execute only if the evaluation reaches it. That is, only if (x \u0026gt; 0) is true.\nSo we basically have an analogue for:\nlet x = 1; if (x \u0026gt; 0) alert( \u0026#39;Greater than zero!\u0026#39; ); Although, the variant with \u0026amp;\u0026amp; appears shorter, if is more obvious and tends to be a little bit more readable. So we recommend using every construct for its purpose: use if if we want if and use \u0026amp;\u0026amp; if we want AND.\n! (NOT) The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !.\nThe syntax is pretty simple:\nresult = !value; The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:\nConverts the operand to boolean type: true/false. Returns the inverse value.\nFor instance:\nalert( !true ); // false alert( !0 ); // true A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:\nalert( !!\u0026#34;non-empty string\u0026#34; ); // true alert( !!null ); // false That is, the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.\nThere’s a little more verbose way to do the same thing – a built-in Boolean function:\nalert( Boolean(\u0026#34;non-empty string\u0026#34;) ); // true alert( Boolean(null) ); // false The precedence of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before \u0026amp;\u0026amp; or ||.\nNullish coalescing operator \u0026lsquo;??\u0026rsquo; The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks ??.\nAs it treats null and undefined similarly, we’ll use a special term here, in this article. For brevity, we’ll say that a value is “defined” when it’s neither null nor undefined.\nThe result of a ?? b is:\nif a is defined, then a, if a isn’t defined, then b. In other words, ?? returns the first argument if it’s not null/undefined. Otherwise, the second one.\nThe nullish coalescing operator isn’t anything completely new. It’s just a nice syntax to get the first “defined” value of the two.\nWe can rewrite result = a ?? b using the operators that we already know, like this:\nresult = (a !== null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; a !== undefined) ? a : b; Now it should be absolutely clear what ?? does. Let’s see where it helps.\nThe common use case for ?? is to provide a default value.\nFor example, here we show user if its value isn’t null/undefined, otherwise Anonymous:\nlet user; alert(user ?? \u0026#34;Anonymous\u0026#34;); // Anonymous (user is undefined) Here’s the example with user assigned to a name:\nlet user = \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;; alert(user ?? \u0026#34;Anonymous\u0026#34;); // John (user is not null/undefined) We can also use a sequence of ?? to select the first value from a list that isn’t null/undefined.\nLet’s say we have a user’s data in variables firstName, lastName or nickName. All of them may be not defined, if the user decided not to fill in the corresponding values.\nWe’d like to display the user name using one of these variables, or show “Anonymous” if all of them are null/undefined.\nLet’s use the ?? operator for that:\nlet firstName = null; let lastName = null; let nickName = \u0026#34;Supercoder\u0026#34;; // shows the first defined value: alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? \u0026#34;Anonymous\u0026#34;); // Supercoder Loops: while and for The “while” loop The while loop has the following syntax:\nwhile (condition) { // code // so-called \u0026#34;loop body\u0026#34; } While the condition is truthy, the code from the loop body is executed.\nFor instance, the loop below outputs i while i \u0026lt; 3:\nlet i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; 3) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2 alert( i ); i++; } A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration. The loop in the example above makes three iterations.\nIf i++ was missing from the example above, the loop would repeat (in theory) forever. In practice, the browser provides ways to stop such loops, and in server-side JavaScript, we can kill the process.\nAny expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and converted to a boolean by while.\nFor instance, a shorter way to write while (i != 0) is while (i):\nlet i = 3; while (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops alert( i ); i--; } Curly braces are not required for a single-line body\nIf the loop body has a single statement, we can omit the curly braces {…}:\nlet i = 3; while (i) alert(i--); The “do…while” loop The condition check can be moved below the loop body using the do..while syntax:\ndo { // loop body } while (condition); The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it’s truthy, execute it again and again.\nlet i = 0; do { alert( i ); i++; } while (i \u0026lt; 3); This form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute at least once regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred: while(…) {…}.\nThe “for” loop The for loop is more complex, but it’s also the most commonly used loop.\nIt looks like this:\nfor (begin; condition; step) { // ... loop body ... } Let’s learn the meaning of these parts by example. The loop below runs alert(i) for i from 0 up to (but not including) 3:\nfor (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2 alert(i); } Let’s examine the for statement part-by-part:\npart begin let i = 0 executes once upon entering the loop condition i\u0026lt; 3 Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops body alert(i) Run again and again while the condition is truthy step i++ Executes after the body on each iteration. The general loop algorithm works like this: Run begin → (if condition → run body and run step) → (if condition → run body and run step) → (if condition → run body and run step) → ... That is, begin executes once, and then it iterates: after each condition test, body and step are executed.\nIf you are new to loops, it could help to go back to the example and reproduce how it runs step-by-step on a piece of paper.\nHere’s exactly what happens in our case:\n// for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) alert(i) // run begin let i = 0 // if condition → run body and run step if (i \u0026lt; 3) { alert(i); i++ } // if condition → run body and run step if (i \u0026lt; 3) { alert(i); i++ } // if condition → run body and run step if (i \u0026lt; 3) { alert(i); i++ } // ...finish, because now i == 3 Breaking the loop Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.\nBut we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.\nFor example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no number is entered:\nlet sum = 0; while (true) { let value = +prompt(\u0026#34;Enter a number\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;); if (!value) break; // (*) sum += value; } alert( \u0026#39;Sum: \u0026#39; + sum ); The break directive is activated at the line (*) if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, alert.\nThe combination “infinite loop + break as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.\nContinue to the next iteration The continue directive is a “lighter version” of break. It doesn’t stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).\nWe can use it if we’re done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one.\nThe loop below uses continue to output only odd values:\nfor (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 10; i++) { // if true, skip the remaining part of the body if (i % 2 == 0) continue; alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9 } For even values of i, the continue directive stops executing the body and passes control to the next iteration of for (with the next number). So the alert is only called for odd values.\nNo break/continue to the right side of ‘?’\nPlease note that syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with the ternary operator ?. In particular, directives such as break/continue aren’t allowed there.\nFor example, if we take this code:\nif (i \u0026gt; 5) { alert(i); } else { continue; } …and rewrite it using a question mark:\n(i \u0026gt; 5) ? alert(i) : continue; // continue isn\u0026#39;t allowed here …it stops working: there’s a syntax error.\nThis is just another reason not to use the question mark operator ? instead of if.\nLabels for break/continue Sometimes we need to break out from multiple nested loops at once.\nFor example, in the code below we loop over i and j, prompting for the coordinates (i, j) from (0,0) to (2,2):\nfor (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { for (let j = 0; j \u0026lt; 3; j++) { let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;); // what if we want to exit from here to Done (below)? } } alert(\u0026#39;Done!\u0026#39;); We need a way to stop the process if the user cancels the input.\nThe ordinary break after input would only break the inner loop. That’s not sufficient – labels, come to the rescue!\nA label is an identifier with a colon before a loop:\nlabelName: for (...) { ... } The break \u0026lt;labelName\u0026gt; statement in the loop below breaks out to the label:\nouter: for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { for (let j = 0; j \u0026lt; 3; j++) { let input = prompt(`Value at coords (${i},${j})`, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;); // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops if (!input) break outer; // (*) // do something with the value... } } alert(\u0026#39;Done!\u0026#39;); In the code above, break outer looks upwards for the label named outer and breaks out of that loop.\nSo the control goes straight from (*) to alert('Done!').\nWe can also move the label onto a separate line:\nouter: for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { ... } The continue directive can also be used with a label. In this case, code execution jumps to the next iteration of the labeled loop.\nLabels do not allow to “jump” anywhere\nLabels do not allow us to jump into an arbitrary place in the code.\nFor example, it is impossible to do this:\nbreak label; // jump to the label below (doesn\u0026#39;t work) label: for (...) A break directive must be inside a code block. Technically, any labelled code block will do, e.g.:\nlabel: { // ... break label; // works // ... } …Although, 99.9% of the time break is used inside loops, as we’ve seen in the examples above.\nA continue is only possible from inside a loop.\nThe \u0026ldquo;switch\u0026rdquo; statement A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.\nIt gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.\nThe syntax The switch has one or more case blocks and an optional default.\nIt looks like this:\nswitch(x) { case \u0026#39;value1\u0026#39;: // if (x === \u0026#39;value1\u0026#39;) ... [break] case \u0026#39;value2\u0026#39;: // if (x === \u0026#39;value2\u0026#39;) ... [break] default: ... [break] } The value of x is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first case (that is, value1) then to the second (value2) and so on. If the equality is found, switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the nearest break (or until the end of switch). If no case is matched then the default code is executed (if it exists). Type matters Let’s emphasize that the equality check is always strict. The values must be of the same type to match.\nFor example, let’s consider the code:\nlet arg = prompt(\u0026#34;Enter a value?\u0026#34;); switch (arg) { case \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;: case \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;: alert( \u0026#39;One or zero\u0026#39; ); break; case \u0026#39;2\u0026#39;: alert( \u0026#39;Two\u0026#39; ); break; case 3: alert( \u0026#39;Never executes!\u0026#39; ); break; default: alert( \u0026#39;An unknown value\u0026#39; ); } For 0, 1, the first alert runs. For 2 the second alert runs. But for 3, the result of the prompt is a string \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;, which is not strictly equal === to the number 3. So we’ve got a dead code in case 3! The default variant will execute. Functions Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.\nFor example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.\nFunctions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.\nWe’ve already seen examples of built-in functions, like alert(message), prompt(message, default) and confirm(question). But we can create functions of our own as well.\nFunction Declaration To create a function we can use a function declaration.\nIt looks like this:\nfunction showMessage() { alert( \u0026#39;Hello everyone!\u0026#39; ); } The function keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function, then a list of parameters between the parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above, we’ll see examples later) and finally the code of the function, also named “the function body”, between curly braces.\nfunction name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) { // body } Our new function can be called by its name: showMessage().\nThe call showMessage() executes the code of the function. Here we will see the message two times.\nThis example clearly demonstrates one of the main purposes of functions: to avoid code duplication.\nIf we ever need to change the message or the way it is shown, it’s enough to modify the code in one place: the function which outputs it.\nLocal variables A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.\nFor example:\nfunction showMessage() { let message = \u0026#34;Hello, I\u0026#39;m JavaScript!\u0026#34;; // local variable alert( message ); } showMessage(); // Hello, I\u0026#39;m JavaScript! alert( message ); // \u0026lt;-- Error! The variable is local to the function Outer Variables A function can access an outer variable as well, for example:\nlet userName = \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;; function showMessage() { let message = \u0026#39;Hello, \u0026#39; + userName; alert(message); } showMessage(); // Hello, John The function has full access to the outer variable. It can modify it as well.\nFor instance:\nlet userName = \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;; function showMessage() { userName = \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;; // (1) changed the outer variable let message = \u0026#39;Hello, \u0026#39; + userName; alert(message); } alert( userName ); // John before the function call showMessage(); alert( userName ); // Bob, the value was modified by the function The outer variable is only used if there’s no local one.\nIf a same-named variable is declared inside the function then it shadows the outer one. For instance, in the code below the function uses the local userName. The outer one is ignored:\nlet userName = \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;; function showMessage() { let userName = \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;; // declare a local variable let message = \u0026#39;Hello, \u0026#39; + userName; // Bob alert(message); } // the function will create and use its own userName showMessage(); alert( userName ); // John, unchanged, the function did not access the outer variable Parameters We can pass arbitrary data to functions using parameters.\nIn the example below, the function has two parameters: from and text.\nfunction showMessage(from, text) { // parameters: from, text alert(from + \u0026#39;: \u0026#39; + text); } showMessage(\u0026#39;Ann\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Hello!\u0026#39;); // Ann: Hello! (1) showMessage(\u0026#39;Ann\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s up?\u0026#34;); // Ann: What\u0026#39;s up? (2) When the function is called in lines (1) and (2), the given values are copied to local variables from and text. Then the function uses them.\nHere’s one more example: we have a variable from and pass it to the function. Please note: the function changes from, but the change is not seen outside, because a function always gets a copy of the value:\nfunction showMessage(from, text) { from = \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; + from + \u0026#39;*\u0026#39;; // make \u0026#34;from\u0026#34; look nicer alert( from + \u0026#39;: \u0026#39; + text ); } let from = \u0026#34;Ann\u0026#34;; showMessage(from, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); // *Ann*: Hello // the value of \u0026#34;from\u0026#34; is the same, the function modified a local copy alert( from ); // Ann When a value is passed as a function parameter, it’s also called an argument.\nIn other words, to put these terms straight:\nA parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function declaration (it’s a declaration time term). An argument is the value that is passed to the function when it is called (it’s a call time term). We declare functions listing their parameters, then call them passing arguments.\nIn the example above, one might say: “the function showMessage is declared with two parameters, then called with two arguments: from and \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo;”.\nDefault values If a function is called, but an argument is not provided, then the corresponding value becomes undefined.\nFor instance, the aforementioned function showMessage(from, text) can be called with a single argument:\nfunction showMessage(from, text = \u0026#34;no text given\u0026#34;) { alert( from + \u0026#34;: \u0026#34; + text ); } showMessage(\u0026#34;Ann\u0026#34;); // Ann: no text given Default parameters in old JavaScript code Several years ago, JavaScript didn’t support the syntax for default parameters. So people used other ways to specify them.\nNowadays, we can come across them in old scripts.\nFor example, an explicit check for undefined:\nfunction showMessage(from, text) { if (text === undefined) { text = \u0026#39;no text given\u0026#39;; } alert( from + \u0026#34;: \u0026#34; + text ); } …Or using the || operator:\nfunction showMessage(from, text) { // If the value of text is falsy, assign the default value // this assumes that text == \u0026#34;\u0026#34; is the same as no text at all text = text || \u0026#39;no text given\u0026#39;; ... } Alternative default parameters Sometimes it makes sense to assign default values for parameters at a later stage after the function declaration.\nWe can check if the parameter is passed during the function execution, by comparing it with undefined:\nfunction showMessage(text) { // ... if (text === undefined) { // if the parameter is missing text = \u0026#39;empty message\u0026#39;; } alert(text); } showMessage(); // empty message Returning a value A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result.\nThe simplest example would be a function that sums two values:\nfunction sum(a, b) { return a + b; } let result = sum(1, 2); console.log( result ); // 3 A function with an empty return or without it returns undefined\nIf a function does not return a value, it is the same as if it returns undefined\nfunction doNothing() { /* empty */ } alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true An empty return is also the same as return undefined:\nfunction doNothing() { return; } alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true One function – one action\nA function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.\nTwo independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case we can make a 3rd function that calls those two).\nA few examples of breaking this rule:\ngetAge – would be bad if it shows an alert with the age (should only get). createForm – would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create it and return). checkPermission – would be bad if it displays the access granted/denied message (should only perform the check and return the result). These examples assume common meanings of prefixes. You and your team are free to agree on other meanings, but usually they’re not much different. In any case, you should have a firm understanding of what a prefix means, what a prefixed function can and cannot do. All same-prefixed functions should obey the rules. And the team should share the knowledge.\nFunction expressions In JavaScript, a function is not a “magical language structure”, but a special kind of value.\nThe syntax that we used before is called a Function Declaration:\nfunction sayHi() { alert( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; ); } There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a Function Expression.\nIt allows us to create a new function in the middle of any expression.\nFor example:\nlet sayHi = function() { alert( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; ); }; Here we can see a variable sayHi getting a value, the new function, created as function() { alert(\u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;); }.\nAs the function creation happens in the context of the assignment expression (to the right side of =), this is a Function Expression.\nPlease note, there’s no name after the function keyword. Omitting a name is allowed for Function Expressions.\nHere we immediately assign it to the variable, so the meaning of these code samples is the same: “create a function and put it into the variable sayHi”.\nIn more advanced situations, that we’ll come across later, a function may be created and immediately called or scheduled for a later execution, not stored anywhere, thus remaining anonymous.\nFunction is a value Let’s reiterate: no matter how the function is created, a function is a value. Both examples above store a function in the sayHi variable.\nWe can even print out that value using alert:\nfunction sayHi() { alert( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; ); } alert( sayHi ); // shows the function code Please note that the last line does not run the function, because there are no parentheses after sayHi. There are programming languages where any mention of a function name causes its execution, but JavaScript is not like that.\nIn JavaScript, a function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value. The code above shows its string representation, which is the source code.\nSurely, a function is a special value, in the sense that we can call it like sayHi().\nBut it’s still a value. So we can work with it like with other kinds of values.\nWe can copy a function to another variable:\nfunction sayHi() { // (1) create alert( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; ); } let func = sayHi; // (2) copy func(); // Hello // (3) run the copy (it works)! sayHi(); // Hello // this still works too (why wouldn\u0026#39;t it) Here’s what happens above in detail:\nThe Function Declaration (1) creates the function and puts it into the variable named sayHi. Line (2) copies it into the variable func. Please note again: there are no parentheses after sayHi. If there were, then func = sayHi() would write the result of the call sayHi() into func, not the function sayHi itself. Now the function can be called as both sayHi() and func(). We could also have used a Function Expression to declare sayHi, in the first line:\nlet sayHi = function() { // (1) create alert( \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; ); }; let func = sayHi; // ... Everything would work the same.\nWhy is there a semicolon at the end?\nYou might wonder, why do Function Expressions have a semicolon ; at the end, but Function Declarations do not:\nfunction sayHi() { // ... } let sayHi = function() { // ... }; The answer is simple: a Function Expression is created here as function(…) {…} inside the assignment statement: let sayHi = …;. The semicolon ; is recommended at the end of the statement, it’s not a part of the function syntax.\nThe semicolon would be there for a simpler assignment, such as let sayHi = 5;, and it’s also there for a function assignment.\nfunction callbacks Let’s look at more examples of passing functions as values and using function expressions.\nWe’ll write a function ask(question, yes, no) with three parameters:\nquestion\nText of the question\nyes\nFunction to run if the answer is “Yes”\nno\nFunction to run if the answer is “No”\nThe function should ask the question and, depending on the user’s answer, call yes() or no():\nfunction ask(question, yes, no) { if (confirm(question)) yes() else no(); } function showOk() { alert( \u0026#34;You agreed.\u0026#34; ); } function showCancel() { alert( \u0026#34;You canceled the execution.\u0026#34; ); } // usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask ask(\u0026#34;Do you agree?\u0026#34;, showOk, showCancel); In practice, such functions are quite useful. The major difference between a real-life ask and the example above is that real-life functions use more complex ways to interact with the user than a simple confirm. In the browser, such functions usually draw a nice-looking question window. But that’s another story.\nThe arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.\nThe idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.\nWe can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:\nfunction ask(question, yes, no) { if (confirm(question)) yes() else no(); } ask( \u0026#34;Do you agree?\u0026#34;, function() { alert(\u0026#34;You agreed.\u0026#34;); }, function() { alert(\u0026#34;You canceled the execution.\u0026#34;); } ); Here, functions are declared right inside the ask(...) call. They have no name, and so are called anonymous. Such functions are not accessible outside of ask (because they are not assigned to variables), but that’s just what we want here.\nSuch code appears in our scripts very naturally, it’s in the spirit of JavaScript.\nA function is a value representing an “action” Regular values like strings or numbers represent the data.\nA function can be perceived as an action.\nWe can pass it between variables and run when we want.\nFunction Expression vs Function Declaration Let’s formulate the key differences between Function Declarations and Expressions.\nFirst, the syntax: how to differentiate between them in the code.\nFunction Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow: // Function Declaration function sum(a, b) { return a + b; } Function Expression: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the “assignment expression” =: // Function Expression let sum = function(a, b) { return a + b; }; The more subtle difference is when a function is created by the JavaScript engine.\nA Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment. Once the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment let sum = function… – here we go, the function is created and can be used (assigned, called, etc. ) from now on.\nFunction Declarations are different.\nA Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined. For example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.\nThat’s due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an “initialization stage”.\nAnd after all Function Declarations are processed, the code is executed. So it has access to these functions.\nFor example, this works:\nsayHi(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;); // Hello, John function sayHi(name) { alert( `Hello, ${name}` ); } The Function Declaration sayHi is created when JavaScript is preparing to start the script and is visible everywhere in it.\n…If it were a Function Expression, then it wouldn’t work\nsayHi(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;); // error! let sayHi = function(name) { // (*) no magic any more alert( `Hello, ${name}` ); }; In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it’s visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it. When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression? As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first thing to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.\nThat’s also better for readability, as it’s easier to look up function f(…) {…} in the code than let f = function(…) {…};. Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”.\n…But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration (we’ve just seen an example), then Function Expression should be used.\nSummary Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code. If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”. If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”. Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block. Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them. In most cases when we need to declare a function, a Function Declaration is preferable, because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. That gives us more flexibility in code organization, and is usually more readable.\nSo we should use a Function Expression only when a Function Declaration is not fit for the task. We’ve seen a couple of examples of that in this chapter, and will see more in the future.\nArrow functions, the basics There’s another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions, that’s often better than Function Expressions.\nIt’s called “arrow functions”, because it looks like this:\nlet func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) =\u0026gt; expression; This creates a function func that accepts arguments arg1..argN, then evaluates the expression on the right side with their use and returns its result.\nIn other words, it’s the shorter version of:\nlet func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) { return expression; }; Let’s see a concrete example:\nlet sum = (a, b) =\u0026gt; a + b; /* This arrow function is a shorter form of: let sum = function(a, b) { return a + b; }; */ alert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3 As you can see, (a, b) =\u0026gt; a + b means a function that accepts two arguments named a and b. Upon the execution, it evaluates the expression a + b and returns the result.\nIf we have only one argument, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted, making that even shorter. For example:\nlet double = n =\u0026gt; n * 2; // roughly the same as: let double = function(n) { return n * 2 } alert( double(3) ); // 6 If there are no arguments, parentheses are empty, but they must be present: let sayHi = () =\u0026gt; alert(\u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;); sayHi(); Arrow functions can be used in the same way as Function Expressions.\nFor instance, to dynamically create a function:\nlet age = prompt(\u0026#34;What is your age?\u0026#34;, 18); let welcome = (age \u0026lt; 18) ? () =\u0026gt; alert(\u0026#39;Hello!\u0026#39;) : () =\u0026gt; alert(\u0026#34;Greetings!\u0026#34;); welcome(); Arrow functions may appear unfamiliar and not very readable at first, but that quickly changes as the eyes get used to the structure.\nThey are very convenient for simple one-line actions, when we’re just too lazy to write many words.\nMultiline arrow functions The arrow functions that we’ve seen so far were very simple. They took arguments from the left of =\u0026gt;, evaluated and returned the right-side expression with them.\nSometimes we need a more complex function, with multiple expressions and statements. In that case, we can enclose them in curly braces. The major difference is that curly braces require a return within them to return a value (just like a regular function does).\nLike this:\nlet sum = (a, b) =\u0026gt; { // the curly brace opens a multiline function let result = a + b; return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit \u0026#34;return\u0026#34; }; alert( sum(1, 2) ); // 3 More to come Here we praised arrow functions for brevity. But that’s not all!\nArrow functions have other interesting features.\nTo study them in-depth, we first need to get to know some other aspects of JavaScript, so we’ll return to arrow functions later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited.\nFor now, we can already use arrow functions for one-line actions and callbacks.\nSummary Arrow functions are handy for simple actions, especially for one-liners. They come in two flavors:\nWithout curly braces: (...args) =\u0026gt; expression – the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result. Parentheses can be omitted, if there’s only a single argument, e.g. n =\u0026gt; n*2. With curly braces: (...args) =\u0026gt; { body } – brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit return to return something.

Instead of writing custom styles, Tailwind provides a collection of utility classes that you can use to style elements directly in the HTML.\n1. Installation and Setup How to install Tailwind using CDN For quick prototyping, you can include Tailwind directly in your project with a CDN. Add the following to your HTML \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag:\nAdd the Play CDN script tag to the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; of your HTML file, and start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.\n\u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://unpkg.com/@tailwindcss/browser@4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 2. Key Concepts in Tailwind CSS Utility-First Approach Tailwind uses small utility classes like text-center, bg-blue-500, and mt-4 to control elements\u0026rsquo; design directly in the HTML. This eliminates the need for writing custom CSS.\nResponsive Design Tailwind provides responsive utilities that help you design mobile-first and scale up for larger screens. You can add breakpoints to utilities using sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, etc.\n3. Core Concepts Colors Tailwind provides a set of predefined colors. You can apply them using classes like bg-blue-500 or text-red-600. Example:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;bg-blue-500 text-white p-4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This is a blue background with white text. \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Spacing (Padding and Margin) Tailwind has utilities for margin (m-*) and padding (p-*), where * is a scale value. Example:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;m-4 p-6\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This element has 1rem margin and 1.5rem padding. \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Typography Tailwind provides utilities for font size (text-*), font weight (font-*), text color (text-*), and line height (leading-*). Example:\n\u0026lt;p class=\u0026#34;text-lg font-semibold leading-relaxed\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This is a large, semi-bold text with relaxed line height. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 4. Layout Utilities Flexbox and Grid Tailwind CSS makes it easy to use Flexbox and CSS Grid with utilities like flex, grid, flex-col, justify-center, etc. Example of Flexbox:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;flex justify-center items-center h-screen\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;bg-gray-200 p-6\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Center me!\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Example of Grid:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;grid grid-cols-3 gap-4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;bg-red-500\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Item 1\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;bg-blue-500\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Item 2\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;bg-green-500\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Item 3\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Container The .container class centers your content and applies responsive width.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;container mx-auto p-4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Content here will be centered. \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 5. Customization You can customize Tailwind’s default theme using the tailwind.config.js file. For example, you can change the color palette, font sizes, spacing, etc.\nmodule.exports = { theme: { extend: { colors: { customBlue: \u0026#39;#123456\u0026#39;, }, }, }, } 7. Tailwind Directives @tailwind base;: Applies the base styles like resets. @tailwind components;: Injects component-level styles. @tailwind utilities;: Includes utility classes like padding, margin, colors, etc. @apply: Use this directive to group utilities into a single class (useful for custom components). .btn { @apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded; } 8. Handling States with Pseudo-Classes Tailwind provides utilities for pseudo-classes such as hover:, focus:, active:, etc. Example:\n\u0026lt;button class=\u0026#34;bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white p-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Hover me! \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; 9. Transitions and Animations You can add smooth transitions and animations using Tailwind’s utility classes. Example:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;transition ease-in-out duration-500 transform hover:scale-110\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Hover to scale up! \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; 10. Plugins Tailwind allows you to extend its functionality with plugins, such as for forms, typography, or aspect ratio utilities. Example of installing a plugin:\nnpm install @tailwindcss/forms Then, add it to your tailwind.config.js:\nmodule.exports = { plugins: [ require(\u0026#39;@tailwindcss/forms\u0026#39;), ], } 11. Tailwind CSS with JIT Mode Just-in-time (JIT) mode generates only the classes you use, reducing file size and speeding up development. To enable JIT:\nmodule.exports = { mode: \u0026#39;jit\u0026#39;, content: [\u0026#39;./**/*.html\u0026#39;], } 12.

Units in CSS px : It is use to define the measurement in pixels. 1px = 1/96th of inch % : It is used to define the measurement as a percentage that is relative to another value (maybe to their parent element). vh : It is relative to the height of the viewpoint(screen). 1vh = 1% or 1/100 of the height of the viewpoint vw : It is relative to the width of the viewpoint(screen). 1vm or 1/100 of the width of the width of viewpoint em : Relative to the font-size of the element 2em means 2 times the size of the current font rem : Relative to font-size of the root element like html tag. vmin : Relative to 1% of viewport\u0026rsquo;s* smaller dimension vmax : Relative to 1% of viewport\u0026rsquo;s* larger dimension Tip: There are mainly two type of fonts sans-serif and serif. The difference is the presence of decorative strokes, or serifs at the beginning and end of letters.\nExamples\nMargin VS Padding: padding: padding is the space inside an element, between its content and its border. margin: margin is the space outside an element, between the element\u0026rsquo;s border and other elements. border: A shorthand property for border-width, border-style, border-color ex: border: 3px solid gray border-radius: A shorthand property for the for border *_radius properties. We can also add radius on only one corner. like using these properties border-bottom-left-radius, border-bottom-right-radius,border-top-left-radius,border-top-right-radius Block VS Inline VS Inline-Block: Block Element:- Start on a new line (occupy full width) and take-up 100% of the width by default. You can set height, width, margin,padding. ex: \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;.\nInline Element:- Do not start on a new line and only take-up as much width as their content/required. Height and width cannot be set/change. ex: \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;a\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;.\nInline-Block Element:- Behave like inline element(do not start on a new line). Allow setting height,width like block elements. Useful for layouts purposes without breaking the flow.ex: \u0026lt;img\u0026gt;,button,\u0026lt;input\u0026gt;.\ndisplay: specifies how a certain HTML should be displayed. attributes: block,inline,inline-block Position Absolute VS Position Relative: Position Absolute:-\nAn element with position: absolute is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (viewport). It does not occupy space in the normal layout, allowing it to move freely within its containing block. Position Relative:-\nAn element with position: relative remains in the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to its original position, using top, right, bottom, and left values. Space for the element is still reserved in the layout, so it affects other elements. position: specifies the type of positioning method used for an element absolute,relative,fixed. Background Properties: background: A shorthand property for all the background properties. It set by img(),color, linear-gradiant(to bottom right, red,yellow) etc. background-size: Specifies the size of the background images like cover,contain etc. background-repeat: Sets if/how a background image will be repeated. like no-repeat, round etc. background-position: specifies the position of a background image like center,right, left,top,bottom. Flexbox: Flexbox is a CSS layout model designed to help arrange elements in a responsive flexible way. It simplifies alignment, distribution, and spacing of items within a container-even when their size is unknown or dynamic. The Flexbox model is one-dimensional, meaning it handles either row or a column layout, Unlike CSS Grid which is two-dimensional(rows and columns). Key Concepts:\nFlex Container: The parent element that holds flex items. We can define a flex container by applying display: flex; to it. Flex items: The child elements of a flex container that will be laid out according to the flexbox rules. Main Axis and Cross Axis: Main Axis(x-axis): This axis along which flex items are placed. It depends on the flex-direction property (row by default). Cross Axis(y-axis): The perpendicular axis to the main axis. for example, if the flex-direction is row, the cross axis will be vertical. display: flex; Defines the element as flex container. flex-direction: Specifies the direction of the main axis like row, column,row-reverse,column-reverse. justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis like start,center,space-between,space-evenlly. align-items: Aligns items along the cross-axis stretch,center, flex-start,flex-end. flex-wrap: The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not. like nowrap,wrap,wrap-reverse. flex-shrink: The flex-shrink property specifies how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container. value like 0 or 1. Pseudo-Class and Pseudo-Elements:- Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are both powerful CSS features used to style elements based on specific states or to target parts of elements that aren\u0026rsquo;t directly available in the DOM, although they serve similar purposes, modifying or styling elements based on conditions, they function differently.\nPseudo-Classes: They targets an element in a specific state, and we use : for pseudo-classes. Syntax: selector:pesudo-class\nCommon Examples:\n:hover when an element is hovered. :focus when an element is focused. :th-child(n) targets the nth child of parent. :active when an element is being clicked. :visited for visited links Pseudo-Elements: Targets part of an element or inserts content before/after it. we use :: for elements. Syntax: selector::pesudo-element\nCommon Examples:\n::before insert content before an element. ::after inserts content after an element. ::first-letter styles the first-letter. ::first-line styles the first line. ::selection styles the selected text. Pseudo Classes Pseudo-Elements Interact with element states (e.g., :hover, :focus) Target parts of an element or add content (e.g., ::before, ::first-letter). Color Science and their Units 1. Color Name: CSS provides a set of predefined names that are recognized by all browsers ex: red,green,blue,black (total around 140 standard names) Example: background-color: red;\n2. Hexadecimal Notation(#RRGGBB): A more precise way to specify color in CSS is using hexadecimal(hx) notation. Hex values are written in the form #RRGGBB, where:\n#RR : represent the red component. #GG : represent the green component. #BB : represent the blue component. The values range is 00-FF, 00 means no color and FF means full intensity. Example: background-color: #11111b; 3. RGB Functional Notation: The rgb notation uses the same concept as hex but, specifies values in the decimal range from 0-255. The format is rgb(red,green,blue), where each color component is an integer between 0(no color) and 255(full intensity). Example: background-color: rgb(255,0.0);\n4. RGBA Functional Notation: rgba() extends the rgb() notation by adding an alpha channel for transparency. The format is rgba(red,green,blue,alpha), where alpha value is a decimal between 0(completely transparent) and 1(completely opoque). Example: background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5).\nGrid in CSS CSS Grid Layout is a powerful two-dimensional layout system designed to handle both rows and columns. It provides a way to create web layouts without relying on floats or positioning.\nCore Concepts of CSS Grid; Grid Container: The parent element where display: grid; is applied. Grid Items: The direct child elements of a grid container. Grid Lines: Horizontal and vertical lines that divide the gird into cells. Defining a Grid: Columns and Rows: Use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the grid. grid-template-columns: Specifies the size of the columns, and how many columns in a grid layout grid-template-rows: Specifies the size of the rows in a grid layout. Gap between Grid items: Use gap,row-gap,column-gap to create spacing. Alignment and Justification: align-items: Aligns items vertically inside the container. justify-items: Aligns items horizontally inside the container. align-content: Vertically aligns the whole grid inside the container (when total grid size is smaller than container). jusitfy-content: Horizontally aligns the whole grid inside the container (when total grid size is smaller than container). other useful: justify-self: Aligns the content for a specific grid item along the row axis align-self: Aligns the content for a specific grid item along the column axis grid-row-start: Specifies where to start the grid item grid-row-end: Specifies where to end the grid item grid-column-start: Specifies where to start the grid item grid-column-end: Specifies where to end the grid item grid-row: A shorthand property for the grid-row-start and the grid-row-end properties.ex: grid-row: 1 / 3; grid-column: A shorthand property for the grid-column-start and the grid-column-end properties.ex: grid-column: 1 / 4; CSS Grid vs Flexbox CSS Grid Flexbox Two-dimensional layout One-dimensional layout Suitable for complex layouts Ideal for simpler layouts (row/column) Explicit rows and columns No rows/columns concept Responsive Web Design 1.Understanding Units The first thing in responsiveness is to understand the Absolute(like px) and Relative(em,vh) Units and given are units in css.\nAbsolute Units These units are fixed and not affected by the size of other elements or the viewport.\npx (pixels): A single pixel on the screen. cm (centimeters): A physical centimeter. mm (millimeters): A physical millimeter. in (inches): A physical inch (1 inch = 2.54 cm). Relative Units These units are based on the size of other elements, the viewport, or the font size.\nRelative to the Font Size em: Relative to the font size of the parent element. rem (root em): Relative to the font size of the root element (\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;). ex: Relative to the height of the lowercase letter \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; in the current font. ch: Relative to the width of the character \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; (zero) in the current font. Relative to the Viewport vw (viewport width): 1% of the viewport’s width. vh (viewport height): 1% of the viewport’s height. vmin: 1% of the smaller dimension (width or height) of the viewport. vmax: 1% of the larger dimension (width or height) of the viewport. Relative to the Element’s Size % (percentage): Relative to the size of the parent element. 3. Flexbox Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Below are key takeaways for using Flexbox in responsive design:\nGeneral Concepts Flex Direction: Use flex-direction: row; for horizontal layouts. Switch to flex-direction: column; for vertical layouts on smaller screens using media queries. Flex Wrap: Use flex-wrap: wrap; to allow flex items to wrap onto new lines if necessary. Flex Property: Use the flex property with percentages (e.g., flex: 50%;) to adjust the width of items based on the screen size. 3. CSS Media Queries Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @mediarule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.\nExample If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:\n@media (max-width: 600px) { body { background-color: lightblue; } Add a Breakpoint: Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.\nMedia queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.\nAlways Design for Mobile First Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices).\nThis means that we must make some changes in our CSS.\nInstead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 768px. This will make our design Mobile First:\nTypical Device Breakpoints There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target five groups:\n/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */ @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} /* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */ @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...} /* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */ @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...} /* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */ @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...} /* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */ @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...} CSS Animations CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript!. An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times. Animations is just transaction from initial to final position. The @keyframes Rule: When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current to the new style at certain times.\n@keyframes animation-name { to{ /* Intial properties */ left: 0%; rotate: 0; top: 0; } from{ /* final properties */ left: 75%; rotate: 360deg; border-radius: 50%; background-color: green; } } /* we can also give animation in percenatge so when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete: */ @keyframes animation-name { 0%{ left: 0%; rotate: 0; top: 0; } 25%{ left: 75%; top: 0; background-color: blue; } 50%{ left: 75%; top: 73%; rotate: 360deg; background-color: green; } 75%{ left: 0; top: 73%; background-color: aqua; } 100%{ left: 0; top: 0; } } CSS Animation Properties Property Description @keyframes Specifies the animation code animation A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties. animation: example 5s linear 2s infinite alternate; animation-delay specifies a delay for start of an animation. like 1s,5s animation-direction Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backward or in alternate cycles.normal,reverse,alternate,alternate-reverse. animation-duration specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle like. 2s,4s. animation-iteration-count Specifies the number of times an animation should be played. like 2,4, or infinite. animation-name Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation. animation-fill-mode Specifies a style for the element when animation is not playing or completed(before it starts, after it ends, or both).none,forwards,backwards,both. animation-timing-function Specifes the speed curve of the animation like ease,linear,ease-in,ease-out,ease-in-out,cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) Animation-timing-function: ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default) linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function.

Every breath becomes a fight; the air seems weighty and pushes against your chest. Until you feel as though you are drowning, the weight of unmet expectations, unresolved grief, and constant disappointment presses down on your soul. Running away is not really an option; you yearn for escape; mountain tops call with promises of seclusion, vast roads whisper freedom into your ears. You thus withdraw inside, running back to yourself as the last haven remaining.\nThe never-ending battle to articulate what you are going through wears you out. Exhaustion penetrates into your bones, therefore rendering the act of hoping or trusting an impossible task. Love seems far, as like it belongs in a world you are no longer able to reach. You paste on a brave front at first since that is what others expect. You convince everyone you are good while donning a mask of normalcy. Still, the lies get more difficult to maintain quickly. You start to shun people—not out of indifference but rather because you have nothing left to offer. Plans are called off, messages go unacknowledged, calls are dismissed. Loneliness starts to be your haven since it feels safer than you could want. Alone, you can breathe without thinking about others.\nYou haven\u0026rsquo;t ceased yearning connection. Somewhere deep within, a part of you still yearns for closeness—for someone who knows. Still, the suffering has caused you caution. You want the flames of your rage and grief to scorish those you love, but you worry bringing your inner turmoil upon others. You thus build towering, impervious barriers to keep everyone out. Your narrative too weighty to discuss, hence it appears impossible to explain your emotions. You worry about being misinterpreted and about people judging you for the wounds you bear as much as for your behavior. Vulnerability seems like a trap, and in a society where rumors travel like wildfire the risk is too large.\nStill, the damage stays, chewing away at you. The weight of past mistakes and losses hangs on your soul like a shadow not going to erase. The toughest is nighttime. The silence sharpens everything—the regrets, the \u0026ldquo;what-ifs,\u0026rdquo; the memories of what you had and lost. \u0026ldquo;If only,\u0026rdquo; you consider. If only you had chosen another course. Just you would have been sufficient. Your chest hurts constantly, a faint aching never going away. The tears have stopped even though the suffering seems too great to contain. Even alone, crying seems like a luxury you cannot afford right now.\nThough certain emotions never alter with time. Despite the years and the heartache, that love you carried for someone still persists, stubborn and immobile. You know, though, you cannot go back to what was. Your heart—fragile, wounded—no longer has the strength to fall another time; the trust you once freely offered feels irreversibly damaged.\nThough it is debilitating, pain does not define you. Indeed, it shapes you, but it does not define you totally. Healing is nonlinear, messy, and usually frustrating. Setbacks and times when the weight seems intolerable will abound. Even in those times, though, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to forgive yourself—for the times you felt weak or stumbled under pressure. Honor the love you bear, even if it is complex or mixed-fevers. Above all, hang on. Because the weight won\u0026rsquo;t last permanently regardless of how heavy it feels right now. Deepest scars can heal as well. The darkest darkness lift too, finally.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/forher/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"cover-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/assets/forher/forher.webp\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere comes a time in life when everything around you seems stifling.
